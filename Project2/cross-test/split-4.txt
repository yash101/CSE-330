of trade to the federal councils it is needless therefore to
remark further on this head than that the manner in which the
restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to
the states a reasonable discretion in providing for the
conveniency of their imports and exports and to the united
states a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion
the remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings
which are either so obvious or have been so fully developed
that they may be passed over without remark the sixth and last
class consists of the several powers and provisions by which
efficacy is given to all the rest  of these the first is the
power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other
powers vested by this constitution in the government of the
united states or in any department or officer thereof few
parts of the constitution have been assailed with more
intemperance than this yet on a fair investigation of it no
part can appear more completely invulnerable without the
substance of this power the whole constitution would be a dead
letter those who object to the article therefore as a part of
the constitution can only mean that the form of the provision is
improper but have they considered whether a better form could
have been substituted there are four other possible methods
which the constitution might have taken on this subject they
might have copied the second article of the existing
confederation which would have prohibited the exercise of any
power not expressly delegated they might have attempted a
positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general
terms necessary and proper they might have attempted a
negative enumeration of them by specifying the powers excepted
from the general definition they might have been altogether
silent on the subject leaving these necessary and proper powers
to construction and inference had the convention taken the
first method of adopting the second article of confederation it
is evident that the new congress would be continually exposed as
their predecessors have been to the alternative of construing
the term expressly with so much rigor as to disarm the
government of all real authority whatever or with so much
latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction
it would be easy to show if it were necessary that no important
power delegated by the articles of confederation has been or
can be executed by congress without recurring more or less to
the doctrine of construction or implication as the powers
delegated under the new system are more extensive the government
which is to administer it would find itself still more distressed
with the alternative of betraying the public interests by doing
nothing or of violating the constitution by exercising powers
indispensably necessary and proper but at the same time not
expressly granted had the convention attempted a positive
enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their
other powers into effect the attempt would have involved a
complete digest of laws on every subject to which the
constitution relates accommodated too not only to the existing
state of things but to all the possible changes which futurity
may produce for in every new application of a general power the
particular powers which are the means of attaining the object of
the general power must always necessarily vary with that object
and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same
had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means
not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into
execution the task would have been no less chimerical and would
have been liable to this further objection that every defect in
the enumeration would have been equivalent to a positive grant of
authority if to avoid this consequence they had attempted a
partial enumeration of the exceptions and described the residue
by the general terms not necessary or proper it must have
happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the
excepted powers only that these would be such as would be least
likely to be assumed or tolerated because the enumeration would
of course select such as would be least necessary or proper and
that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the
residuum would be less forcibly excepted than if no partial
enumeration had been made had the constitution been silent on
this head there can be no doubt that all the particular powers
requisite as means of executing the general powers would have
resulted to the government by unavoidable implication no axiom
is more clearly established in law or in reason than that
wherever the end is required the means are authorized wherever
a general power to do a thing is given every particular power
necessary for doing it is included had this last method
therefore been pursued by the convention every objection now
urged against their plan would remain in all its plausibility
and the real inconveniency would be incurred of not removing a
pretext which may be seized on critical occasions for drawing
into question the essential powers of the union if it be asked
what is to be the consequence in case the congress shall
misconstrue this part of the constitution and exercise powers
not warranted by its true meaning i answer the same as if they
should misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them as
if the general power had been reduced to particulars and any one
of these were to be violated the same in short as if the state
legislatures should violate the irrespective constitutional
authorities in the first instance the success of the usurpation
will depend on the executive and judiciary departments which are
to expound and give effect to the legislative acts and in the
last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can by
the election of more faithful representatives annul the acts of
the usurpers the truth is that this ultimate redress may be
more confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal
than of the state legislatures for this plain reason that as
every such act of the former will be an invasion of the rights of
the latter these will be ever ready to mark the innovation to
sound the alarm to the people and to exert their local influence
in effecting a change of federal representatives there being no
such intermediate body between the state legislatures and the
people interested in watching the conduct of the former
violations of the state constitutions are more likely to remain
unnoticed and unredressed  this constitution and the laws
of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof
and all treaties made or which shall be made under the
authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the
land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby any
thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary
notwithstanding the indiscreet zeal of the adversaries to the
constitution has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it
also without which it would have been evidently and radically
defective to be fully sensible of this we need only suppose for
a moment that the supremacy of the state constitutions had been
left complete by a saving clause in their favor in the first
place as these constitutions invest the state legislatures with
absolute sovereignty in all cases not excepted by the existing
articles of confederation all the authorities contained in the
proposed constitution so far as they exceed those enumerated in
the confederation would have been annulled and the new congress
would have been reduced to the same impotent condition with their
predecessors in the next place as the constitutions of some of
the states do not even expressly and fully recognize the existing
powers of the confederacy an express saving of the supremacy of
the former would in such states have brought into question
every power contained in the proposed constitution in the third
place as the constitutions of the states differ much from each
other it might happen that a treaty or national law of great
and equal importance to the states would interfere with some and
not with other constitutions and would consequently be valid in
some of the states at the same time that it would have no effect
in others in fine the world would have seen for the first
time a system of government founded on an inversion of the
fundamental principles of all government it would have seen the
authority of the whole society every where subordinate to the
authority of the parts it would have seen a monster in which
the head was under the direction of the members  the
senators and representatives and the members of the several
state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both
of the united states and the several states shall be bound by
oath or affirmation to support this constitution it has been
asked why it was thought necessary that the state magistracy
should be bound to support the federal constitution and
unnecessary that a like oath should be imposed on the officers of
the united states in favor of the state constitutions several
reasons might be assigned for the distinction i content myself
with one which is obvious and conclusive the members of the
federal government will have no agency in carrying the state
constitutions into effect the members and officers of the state
governments on the contrary will have an essential agency in
giving effect to the federal constitution the election of the
president and senate will depend in all cases on the
legislatures of the several states and the election of the house
of representatives will equally depend on the same authority in
the first instance and will probably forever be conducted by
the officers and according to the laws of the states  among
the provisions for giving efficacy to the federal powers might be
added those which belong to the executive and judiciary
departments but as these are reserved for particular examination
in another place i pass them over in this we have now
reviewed in detail all the articles composing the sum or
quantity of power delegated by the proposed constitution to the
federal government and are brought to this undeniable
conclusion that no part of the power is unnecessary or improper
for accomplishing the necessary objects of the union the
question therefore whether this amount of power shall be
granted or not resolves itself into another question whether or
not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the union
shall be established or in other words whether the union
itself shall be preserved publius

the alleged danger from the powers of the union to the state
governments considered
for the independent fournal 
madison
to the people of the state of new york
having shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal
government is unnecessary or improper the next question to be
considered is whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous
to the portion of authority left in the several states the
adversaries to the plan of the convention instead of considering
in the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary
for the purposes of the federal government have exhausted
themselves in a secondary inquiry into the possible consequences
of the proposed degree of power to the governments of the
particular states but if the union as has been shown be
essential to the security of the people of america against
foreign danger if it be essential to their security against
contentions and wars among the different states if it be
essential to guard them against those violent and oppressive
factions which embitter the blessings of liberty and against
those military establishments which must gradually poison its
very fountain if in a word the union be essential to the
happiness of the people of america is it not preposterous to
urge as an objection to a government without which the objects
of the union cannot be attained that such a government may
derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual
states was then the american revolution effected was the
american confederacy formed was the precious blood of thousands
spilt and the hardearned substance of millions lavished not
that the people of america should enjoy peace liberty and
safety but that the government of the individual states that
particular municipal establishments might enjoy a certain extent
of power and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of
sovereignty we have heard of the impious doctrine in the old
world that the people were made for kings not kings for the
people is the same doctrine to be revived in the new in another
shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed
to the views of political institutions of a different form it is
too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the
public good the real welfare of the great body of the people is
the supreme object to be pursued and that no form of government
whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the
attainment of this object were the plan of the convention
adverse to the public happiness my voice would be reject the
plan were the union itself inconsistent with the public
happiness it would be abolish the union in like manner as far
as the sovereignty of the states cannot be reconciled to the
happiness of the people the voice of every good citizen must be
let the former be sacrificed to the latter how far the sacrifice
is necessary has been shown how far the unsacrificed residue
will be endangered is the question before us several important
considerations have been touched in the course of these papers
which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the
federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the state
governments the more i revolve the subject the more fully i am
persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by
the preponderancy of the last than of the first scale we have
seen in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies
the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the
members to despoil the general government of its authorities
with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself
against the encroachments although in most of these examples
the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration
as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the
fate of the former yet as the states will retain under the
proposed constitution a very extensive portion of active
sovereignty the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded in
the achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a
degree and species of power which gave it a considerable
likeness to the government framed by the convention the lycian
confederacy as far as its principles and form are transmitted
must have borne a still greater analogy to it yet history does
not inform us that either of them ever degenerated or tended to
degenerate into one consolidated government on the contrary we
know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity
of the federal authority to prevent the dissensions and finally
the disunion of the subordinate authorities these cases are the
more worthy of our attention as the external causes by which the
component parts were pressed together were much more numerous and
powerful than in our case and consequently less powerful
ligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the
head and to each other in the feudal system we have seen a
similar propensity exemplified notwithstanding the want of
proper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns
and the people and the sympathy in some instances between the
general sovereign and the latter it usually happened that the
local sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for encroachments
had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and
subordination and particularly had the local sovereigns
possessed the affections of the people the great kingdoms in
europe would at this time consist of as many independent princes
as there were formerly feudatory barons the state government
will have the advantage of the federal government whether we
compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on
the other to the weight of personal influence which each side
will possess to the powers respectively vested in them to the
predilection and probable support of the people to the
disposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures
of each other the state governments may be regarded as
constituent and essential parts of the federal government whilst
the latter is nowise essential to the operation or organization
of the former without the intervention of the state
legislatures the president of the united states cannot be
elected at all they must in all cases have a great share in his
appointment and will perhaps in most cases of themselves
determine it the senate will be elected absolutely and
exclusively by the state legislatures even the house of
representatives though drawn immediately from the people will
be chosen very much under the influence of that class of men
whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an
election into the state legislatures thus each of the principal
branches of the federal government will owe its existence more or
less to the favor of the state governments and must consequently
feel a dependence which is much more likely to beget a
disposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards them on
the other side the component parts of the state governments will
in no instance be indebted for their appointment to the direct
agency of the federal government and very little if at all to
the local influence of its members the number of individuals
employed under the constitution of the united states will be much
smaller than the number employed under the particular states
there will consequently be less of personal influence on the side
of the former than of the latter the members of the legislative
executive and judiciary departments of thirteen and more states
the justices of peace officers of militia ministerial officers
of justice with all the county corporation and town officers
for three millions and more of people intermixed and having
particular acquaintance with every class and circle of people
must exceed beyond all proportion both in number and influence
those of every description who will be employed in the
administration of the federal system compare the members of the
three great departments of the thirteen states excluding from
the judiciary department the justices of peace with the members
of the corresponding departments of the single government of the
union compare the militia officers of three millions of people
with the military and marine officers of any establishment which
is within the compass of probability or i may add of
possibility and in this view alone we may pronounce the
advantage of the states to be decisive if the federal government
is to have collectors of revenue the state governments will have
theirs also and as those of the former will be principally on
the seacoast and not very numerous whilst those of the latter
will be spread over the face of the country and will be very
numerous the advantage in this view also lies on the same side
it is true that the confederacy is to possess and may exercise
the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes
throughout the states but it is probable that this power will
not be resorted to except for supplemental purposes of revenue
that an option will then be given to the states to supply their
quotas by previous collections of their own and that the
eventual collection under the immediate authority of the union
will generally be made by the officers and according to the
rules appointed by the several states indeed it is extremely
probable that in other instances particularly in the
organization of the judicial power the officers of the states
will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the union
should it happen however that separate collectors of internal
revenue should be appointed under the federal government the
influence of the whole number would not bear a comparison with
that of the multitude of state officers in the opposite scale
within every district to which a federal collector would be
allotted there would not be less than thirty or forty or even
more officers of different descriptions and many of them
persons of character and weight whose influence would lie on the
side of the state the powers delegated by the proposed
constitution to the federal government are few and defined those
which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and
indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external
objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce with
which last the power of taxation will for the most part be
connected the powers reserved to the several states will extend
to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs
concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and
the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state the
operations of the federal government will be most extensive and
important in times of war and danger those of the state
governments in times of peace and security as the former
periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter the
state governments will here enjoy another advantage over the
federal government the more adequate indeed the federal powers
may be rendered to the national defense the less frequent will
be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over
the governments of the particular states if the new constitution
be examined with accuracy and candor it will be found that the
change which it proposes consists much less in the addition of
new powers to the union than in the invigoration of its original
powers the regulation of commerce it is true is a new power
but that seems to be an addition which few oppose and from which
no apprehensions are entertained the powers relating to war and
peace armies and fleets treaties and finance with the other
more considerable powers are all vested in the existing congress
by the articles of confederation the proposed change does not
enlarge these powers it only substitutes a more effectual mode
of administering them the change relating to taxation may be
regarded as the most important and yet the present congress have
as complete authority to require of the states indefinite
supplies of money for the common defense and general welfare as
the future congress will have to require them of individual
citizens and the latter will be no more bound than the states
themselves have been to pay the quotas respectively taxed on
them had the states complied punctually with the articles of
confederation or could their compliance have been enforced by as
peaceable means as may be used with success towards single
persons our past experience is very far from countenancing an
opinion that the state governments would have lost their
constitutional powers and have gradually undergone an entire
consolidation to maintain that such an event would have ensued
would be to say at once that the existence of the state
governments is incompatible with any system whatever that
accomplishes the essental purposes of the union publius 
federalist no 
the influence of the state and federal governments compared
from the new york packet tuesday january   
madison
to the people of the state of new york
resuming the subject of the last paper i proceed to inquire
whether the federal government or the state governments will have
the advantage with regard to the predilection and support of the
people notwithstanding the different modes in which they are
appointed we must consider both of them as substantially
dependent on the great body of the citizens of the united states
i assume this position here as it respects the first reserving
the proofs for another place the federal and state governments
are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people
constituted with different powers and designed for different
purposes the adversaries of the constitution seem to have lost
sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on this
subject and to have viewed these different establishments not
only as mutual rivals and enemies but as uncontrolled by any
common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each
other these gentlemen must here be reminded of their error they
must be told that the ultimate authority wherever the derivative
may be found resides in the people alone and that it will not
depend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the
different governments whether either or which of them will be
able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the
other truth no less than decency requires that the event in
every case should be supposed to depend on the sentiments and
sanction of their common constituents many considerations
besides those suggested on a former occasion seem to place it
beyond doubt that the first and most natural attachment of the
people will be to the governments of their respective states
into the administration of these a greater number of individuals
will expect to rise from the gift of these a greater number of
offices and emoluments will flow by the superintending care of
these all the more domestic and personal interests of the people
will be regulated and provided for with the affairs of these
the people will be more familiarly and minutely conversant and
with the members of these will a greater proportion of the
people have the ties of personal acquaintance and friendship and
of family and party attachments on the side of these
therefore the popular bias may well be expected most strongly to
incline experience speaks the same language in this case the
federal administration though hitherto very defective in
comparison with what may be hoped under a better system had
during the war and particularly whilst the independent fund of
paper emissions was in credit an activity and importance as
great as it can well have in any future circumstances whatever
it was engaged too in a course of measures which had for their
object the protection of everything that was dear and the
acquisition of everything that could be desirable to the people
at large it was nevertheless invariably found after the
transient enthusiasm for the early congresses was over that the
attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their
own particular governments that the federal council was at no
time the idol of popular favor and that opposition to proposed
enlargements of its powers and importance was the side usually
taken by the men who wished to build their political consequence
on the prepossessions of their fellowcitizens if therefore
as has been elsewhere remarked the people should in future
become more partial to the federal than to the state governments
the change can only result from such manifest and irresistible
proofs of a better administration as will overcome all their
antecedent propensities and in that case the people ought not
surely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence where
they may discover it to be most due but even in that case the
state governments could have little to apprehend because it is
only within a certain sphere that the federal power can in the
nature of things be advantageously administered the remaining
points on which i propose to compare the federal and state
governments are the disposition and the faculty they may
respectively possess to resist and frustrate the measures of
each other it has been already proved that the members of the
federal will be more dependent on the members of the state
governments than the latter will be on the former it has
appeared also that the prepossessions of the people on whom
both will depend will be more on the side of the state
governments than of the federal government so far as the
disposition of each towards the other may be influenced by these
causes the state governments must clearly have the advantage
but in a distinct and very important point of view the advantage
will lie on the same side the prepossessions which the members
themselves will carry into the federal government will generally
be favorable to the states whilst it will rarely happen that
the members of the state governments will carry into the public
councils a bias in favor of the general government a local
spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of
congress than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures
of the particular states every one knows that a great proportion
of the errors committed by the state legislatures proceeds from
the disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and
permanent interest of the state to the particular and separate
views of the counties or districts in which they reside and if
they do not sufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the
collective welfare of their particular state how can it be
imagined that they will make the aggregate prosperity of the
union and the dignity and respectability of its government the
objects of their affections and consultations for the same
reason that the members of the state legislatures will be
unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects
the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach
themselves too much to local objects the states will be to the
latter what counties and towns are to the former measures will
too often be decided according to their probable effect not on
the national prosperity and happiness but on the prejudices
interests and pursuits of the governments and people of the
individual states what is the spirit that has in general
characterized the proceedings of congress a perusal of their
journals as well as the candid acknowledgments of such as have
had a seat in that assembly will inform us that the members
have but too frequently displayed the character rather of
partisans of their respective states than of impartial guardians
of a common interest that where on one occasion improper
sacrifices have been made of local considerations to the
aggrandizement of the federal government the great interests of
the nation have suffered on a hundred from an undue attention to
the local prejudices interests and views of the particular
states i mean not by these reflections to insinuate that the
new federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of
policy than the existing government may have pursued much less
that its views will be as confined as those of the state
legislatures but only that it will partake sufficiently of the
spirit of both to be disinclined to invade the rights of the
individual states or the preorgatives of their governments the
motives on the part of the state governments to augment their
prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government will be
overruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members were
it admitted however that the federal government may feel an
equal disposition with the state governments to extend its power
beyond the due limits the latter would still have the advantage
in the means of defeating such encroachments if an act of a
particular state though unfriendly to the national government
be generally popular in that state and should not too grossly
violate the oaths of the state officers it is executed
immediately and of course by means on the spot and depending on
the state alone the opposition of the federal government or the
interposition of federal officers would but inflame the zeal of
all parties on the side of the state and the evil could not be
prevented or repaired if at all without the employment of means
which must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty
on the other hand should an unwarrantable measure of the federal
government be unpopular in particular states which would seldom
fail to be the case or even a warrantable measure be so which
may sometimes be the case the means of opposition to it are
powerful and at hand the disquietude of the people their
repugnance and perhaps refusal to cooperate with the officers
of the union the frowns of the executive magistracy of the
state the embarrassments created by legislative devices which
would often be added on such occasions would oppose in any
state difficulties not to be despised would form in a large
state very serious impediments and where the sentiments of
several adjoining states happened to be in unison would present
obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing
to encounter but ambitious encroachments of the federal
government on the authority of the state governments would not
excite the opposition of a single state or of a few states
only they would be signals of general alarm every government
would espouse the common cause a correspondence would be
opened plans of resistance would be concerted one spirit would
animate and conduct the whole the same combinations in short
would result from an apprehension of the federal as was produced
by the dread of a foreign yoke and unless the projected
innovations should be voluntarily renounced the same appeal to
a trial of force would be made in the one case as was made in the
other but what degree of madness could ever drive the federal
government to such an extremity in the contest with great
britain one part of the empire was employed against the other
the more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous
part the attempt was unjust and unwise but it was not in
speculation absolutely chimerical but what would be the contest
in the case we are supposing who would be the parties a few
representatives of the people would be opposed to the people
themselves or rather one set of representatives would be
contending against thirteen sets of representatives with the
whole body of their common constituents on the side of the
latter the only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall
of the state governments is the visionary supposition that the
federal government may previously accumulate a military force for
the projects of ambition the reasonings contained in these
papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed if it
could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger
that the people and the states should for a sufficient period of
time elect an uninterupted succession of men ready to betray
both that the traitors should throughout this period
uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the
extension of the military establishment that the governments
and the people of the states should silently and patiently behold
the gathering storm and continue to supply the materials until
it should be prepared to burst on their own heads must appear to
every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious
jealousy or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal
than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism
extravagant as the supposition is let it however be made let a
regular army fully equal to the resources of the country be
formed and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal
government still it would not be going too far to say that the
state governments with the people on their side would be able
to repel the danger the highest number to which according to
the best computation a standing army can be carried in any
country does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number
of souls or one twentyfifth part of the number able to bear
arms this proportion would not yield in the united states an
army of more than twentyfive or thirty thousand men to these
would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of
citizens with arms in their hands officered by men chosen from
among themselves fighting for their common liberties and united
and conducted by governments possessing their affections and
confidence it may well be doubted whether a militia thus
circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of
regular troops those who are best acquainted with the last
successful resistance of this country against the british arms
will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it besides the
advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the
people of almost every other nation the existence of
subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by
which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against
the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a
simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the
military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe which
are carried as far as the public resources will bear the
governments are afraid to trust the people with arms and it is
not certain that with this aid alone they would not be able to
shake off their yokes but were the people to possess the
additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves
who could collect the national will and direct the national
force and of officers appointed out of the militia by these
governments and attached both to them and to the militia it may
be affirmed with the greatest assurance that the throne of every
tyranny in europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the
legions which surround it let us not insult the free and gallant
citizens of america with the suspicion that they would be less
able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual
possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be
to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors let us
rather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can
ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment
by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious
measures which must precede and produce it the argument under
the present head may be put into a very concise form which
appears altogether conclusive either the mode in which the
federal government is to be constructed will render it
sufficiently dependent on the people or it will not on the
first supposition it will be restrained by that dependence from
forming schemes obnoxious to their constituents on the other
supposition it will not possess the confidence of the people
and its schemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the
state governments who will be supported by the people on
summing up the considerations stated in this and the last paper
they seem to amount to the most convincing evidence that the
powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as
little formidable to those reserved to the individual states as
they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of
the union and that all those alarms which have been sounded of
a meditated and consequential annihilation of the state
governments must on the most favorable interpretation be
ascribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them publius

the particular structure of the new government and the
distribution of power among its different parts
from the new york packet friday february   
madison
to the people of the state of new york
having reviewed the general form of the proposed government and
the general mass of power allotted to it i proceed to examine
the particular structure of this government and the distribution
of this mass of power among its constituent parts one of the
principal objections inculcated by the more respectable
adversaries to the constitution is its supposed violation of the
political maxim that the legislative executive and judiciary
departments ought to be separate and distinct in the structure
of the federal government no regard it is said seems to have
been paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty the
several departments of power are distributed and blended in such
a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form
and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the
danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other
parts no political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic
value or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened
patrons of liberty than that on which the objection is founded
the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and
judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and
whether hereditary selfappointed or elective may justly be
pronounced the very definition of tyranny were the federal
constitution therefore really chargeable with the accumulation
of power or with a mixture of powers having a dangerous
tendency to such an accumulation no further arguments would be
necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system i
persuade myself however that it will be made apparent to every
one that the charge cannot be supported and that the maxim on
which it relies has been totally misconceived and misapplied in
order to form correct ideas on this important subject it will be
proper to investigate the sense in which the preservation of
liberty requires that the three great departments of power should
be separate and distinct the oracle who is always consulted and
cited on this subject is the celebrated montesquieu if he be not
the author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics
he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most
effectually to the attention of mankind let us endeavor in the
first place to ascertain his meaning on this point the british
constitution was to montesquieu what homer has been to the
didactic writers on epic poetry as the latter have considered
the work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the
principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn and by
which all similar works were to be judged so this great
political critic appears to have viewed the constitution of
england as the standard or to use his own expression as the
mirror of political liberty and to have delivered in the form
of elementary truths the several characteristic principles of
that particular system that we may be sure then not to mistake
his meaning in this case let us recur to the source from which
the maxim was drawn                                             
                         on the slightest view of the british
constitution we must perceive that the legislative executive
and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and
distinct from each other the executive magistrate forms an
integral part of the legislative authority he alone has the
prerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns which
when made have under certain limitations the force of
legislative acts all the members of the judiciary department are
appointed by him can be removed by him on the address of the two
houses of parliament and form when he pleases to consult them
one of his constitutional councils one branch of the legislative
department forms also a great constitutional council to the
executive chief as on another hand it is the sole depositary
of judicial power in cases of impeachment and is invested with
the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases the
judges again are so far connected with the legislative
department as often to attend and participate in its
deliberations though not admitted to a legislative vote from
these facts by which montesquieu was guided it may clearly be
inferred that in saying there can be no liberty where the
legislative and executive powers are united in the same person
or body of magistrates or if the power of judging be not
separated from the legislative and executive powers he did not
mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency in
or no control over the acts of each other his meaning as his
own words import and still more conclusively as illustrated by
the example in his eye can amount to no more than this that
where the whole power of one department is exercised by the same
hands which possess the whole power of another department the
fundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted this
would have been the case in the constitution examined by him if
the king who is the sole executive magistrate had possessed
also the complete legislative power or the supreme
administration of justice or if the entire legislative body had
possessed the supreme judiciary or the supreme executive
authority this however is not among the vices of that
constitution the magistrate in whom the whole executive power
resides cannot of himself make a law though he can put a
negative on every law nor administer justice in person though
he has the appointment of those who do administer it the judges
can exercise no executive prerogative though they are shoots
from the executive stock nor any legislative function though
they may be advised with by the legislative councils the entire
legislature can perform no judiciary act though by the joint act
of two of its branches the judges may be removed from their
offices and though one of its branches is possessed of the
judicial power in the last resort the entire legislature again
can exercise no executive prerogative though one of its branches
constitutes the supreme executive magistracy and another on the
impeachment of a third can try and condemn all the subordinate
officers in the executive department the reasons on which
montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his
meaning when the legislative and executive powers are united
in the same person or body says he there can be no liberty
because apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or senate
should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical
manner  again were the power of judging joined with the
legislative the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed
to arbitrary control for the judge would then be the legislator
were it joined to the executive power the judge might behave
with all the violence of an oppressor  some of these reasons
are more fully explained in other passages but briefly stated as
they are here they sufficiently establish the meaning which we
have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author     
                                                                
if we look into the constitutions of the several states we find
that notwithstanding the emphatical and in some instances the
unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down there
is not a single instance in which the several departments of
power have been kept absolutely separate and distinct new
hampshire whose constitution was the last formed seems to have
been fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of
avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments and has
qualified the doctrine by declaring that the legislative
executive and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate
from and independent of each other as the nature of a free
government will admit or as is consistent with that chain of
connection that binds the whole fabric of the constitution in one
indissoluble bond of unity and amity  her constitution
accordingly mixes these departments in several respects the
senate which is a branch of the legislative department is also
a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments the
president who is the head of the executive department is the
presiding member also of the senate and besides an equal vote
in all cases has a casting vote in case of a tie the executive
head is himself eventually elective every year by the
legislative department and his council is every year chosen by
and from the members of the same department several of the
officers of state are also appointed by the legislature and the
members of the judiciary department are appointed by the
executive department the constitution of massachusetts has
observed a sufficient though less pointed caution in expressing
this fundamental article of liberty it declares that the
legislative department shall never exercise the executive and
judicial powers or either of them the executive shall never
exercise the legislative and judicial powers or either of them
the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive
powers or either of them  this declaration corresponds
precisely with the doctrine of montesquieu as it has been
explained and is not in a single point violated by the plan of
the convention it goes no farther than to prohibit any one of
the entire departments from exercising the powers of another
department in the very constitution to which it is prefixed a
partial mixture of powers has been admitted the executive
magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body and
the senate which is a part of the legislature is a court of
impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary
departments the members of the judiciary department again are
appointable by the executive department and removable by the
same authority on the address of the two legislative branches
lastly a number of the officers of government are annually
appointed by the legislative department as the appointment to
offices particularly executive offices is in its nature an
executive function the compilers of the constitution have in
this last point at least violated the rule established by
themselves i pass over the constitutions of rhode island and
connecticut because they were formed prior to the revolution
and even before the principle under examination had become an
object of political attention the constitution of new york
contains no declaration on this subject but appears very
clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of
improperly blending the different departments it gives
nevertheless to the executive magistrate a partial control over
the legislative department and what is more gives a like
control to the judiciary department and even blends the
executive and judiciary departments in the exercise of this
control in its council of appointment members of the
legislative are associated with the executive authority in the
appointment of officers both executive and judiciary and its
court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is
to consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal
members of the judiciary department the constitution of new
jersey has blended the different powers of government more than
any of the preceding the governor who is the executive
magistrate is appointed by the legislature is chancellor and
ordinary or surrogate of the state is a member of the supreme
court of appeals and president with a casting vote of one of
the legislative branches the same legislative branch acts again
as executive council of the governor and with him constitutes
the court of appeals the members of the judiciary department are
appointed by the legislative department and removable by one
branch of it on the impeachment of the other according to the
constitution of pennsylvania the president who is the head of
the executive department is annually elected by a vote in which
the legislative department predominates in conjunction with an
executive council he appoints the members of the judiciary
department and forms a court of impeachment for trial of all
officers judiciary as well as executive the judges of the
supreme court and justices of the peace seem also to be removable
by the legislature and the executive power of pardoning in
certain cases to be referred to the same department the members
of the executive counoil are made exofficio justices of peace
throughout the state in delaware the chief executive magistrate
is annually elected by the legislative department the speakers
of the two legislative branches are vicepresidents in the
executive department the executive chief with six others
appointed three by each of the legislative branches constitutes
the supreme court of appeals he is joined with the legislative
department in the appointment of the other judges throughout the
states it appears that the members of the legislature may at the
same time be justices of the peace in this state the members of
one branch of it are exofficio justices of the peace as are
also the members of the executive council the principal officers
of the executive department are appointed by the legislative and
one branch of the latter forms a court of impeachments all
officers may be removed on address of the legislature maryland
has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified terms declaring
that the legislative executive and judicial powers of
government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each
other her constitution notwithstanding makes the executive
magistrate appointable by the legislative department and the
members of the judiciary by the executive department the
language of virginia is still more pointed on this subject her
constitution declares that the legislative executive and
judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct so that
neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other nor
shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at
the same time except that the justices of county courts shall be
eligible to either house of assembly  yet we find not only
this express exception with respect to the members of the
irferior courts but that the chief magistrate with his
executive council are appointable by the legislature that two
members of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure
of the legislature and that all the principal offices both
executive and judiciary are filled by the same department the
executive prerogative of pardon also is in one case vested in
the legislative department the constitution of north carolina
which declares that the legislative executive and supreme
judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and
distinct from each other refers at the same time to the
legislative department the appointment not only of the executive
chief but all the principal officers within both that and the
judiciary department in south carolina the constitution makes
the executive magistracy eligible by the legislative department
it gives to the latter also the appointment of the members of
the judiciary department including even justices of the peace
and sheriffs and the appointment of officers in the executive
department down to captains in the army and navy of the state
in the constitution of georgia where it is declared that the
legislative executive and judiciary departments shall be
separate and distinct so that neither exercise the powers
properly belonging to the other we find that the executive
department is to be filled by appointments of the legislature
and the executive prerogative of pardon to be finally exercised
by the same authority even justices of the peace are to be
appointed by the legislature in citing these cases in which
the legislative executive and judiciary departments have not
been kept totally separate and distinct i wish not to be
regarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the
several state governments i am fully aware that among the many
excellent principles which they exemplify they carry strong
marks of the haste and still stronger of the inexperience under
which they were framed it is but too obvious that in some
instances the fundamental principle under consideration has been
violated by too great a mixture and even an actual
consolidation of the different powers and that in no instance
has a competent provision been made for maintaining in practice
the separation delineated on paper what i have wished to evince
is that the charge brought against the proposed constitution of
violating the sacred maxim of free government is warranted
neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author
nor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in
america this interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing
paper publius 
federalist no 
these departments should not be so far separated as to have no
constitutional control over each other
from the new york packet friday february   
madison
to the people of the state of new york
it was shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there
examined does not require that the legislative executive and
judiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each
other i shall undertake in the next place to show that unless
these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to
each a constitutional control over the others the degree of
separation which the maxim requires as essential to a free
government can never in practice be duly maintained it is
agreed on all sides that the powers properly belonging to one of
the departments ought not to be directly and completely
administered by either of the other departments it is equally
evident that none of them ought to possess directly or
indirectly an overruling influence over the others in the
administration of their respective powers it will not be denied
that power is of an encroaching nature and that it ought to be
effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it
after discriminating therefore in theory the several classes
of power as they may in their nature be legislative executive
or judiciary the next and most difficult task is to provide some
practical security for each against the invasion of the others
what this security ought to be is the great problem to be
solved will it be sufficient to mark with precision the
boundaries of these departments in the constitution of the
government and to trust to these parchment barriers against the
encroaching spirit of power this is the security which appears
to have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of
the american constitutions but experience assures us that the
efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated and that
some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the
more feeble against the more powerful members of the
government the legislative department is everywhere extending
the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its
impetuous vortex the founders of our republics have so much
merit for the wisdom which they have displayed that no task can
be less pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which
they have fallen a respect for truth however obliges us to
remark that they seem never for a moment to have turned their
eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and
allgrasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate supported
and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative
authority they seem never to have recollected the danger from
legislative usurpations which by assembling all power in the
same hands must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by
executive usurpations in a government where numerous and
extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary
monarch the executive department is very justly regarded as the
source of danger and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal
for liberty ought to inspire in a democracy where a multitude
of people exercise in person the legislative functions and are
continually exposed by their incapacity for regular deliberation
and concerted measures to the ambitious intrigues of their
executive magistrates tyranny may well be apprehended on some
favorable emergency to start up in the same quarter but in a
representative republic where the executive magistracy is
carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of its
power and where the legislative power is exercised by an
assembly which is inspired by a supposed influence over the
people with an intrepid confidence in its own strength which is
sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a
multitude yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the
objects of its passions by means which reason prescribes it is
against the enterprising ambition of this department that the
people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their
precautions the legislative department derives a superiority in
our governments from other circumstances its constitutional
powers being at once more extensive and less susceptible of
precise limits it can with the greater facility mask under
complicated and indirect measures the encroachments which it
makes on the coordinate departments it is not unfrequently a
question of real nicety in legislative bodies whether the
operation of a particular measure will or will not extend
beyond the legislative sphere on the other side the executive
power being restrained within a narrower compass and being more
simple in its nature and the judiciary being described by
landmarks still less uncertain projects of usurpation by either
of these departments would immediately betray and defeat
themselves nor is this all as the legislative department alone
has access to the pockets of the people and has in some
constitutions full discretion and in all a prevailing influence
over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other
departments a dependence is thus created in the latter which
gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former i
have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what i
advance on this subject were it necessary to verify this
experience by particular proofs they might be multiplied
without end i might find a witness in every citizen who has
shared in or been attentive to the course of public
administrations i might collect vouchers in abundance from the
records and archives of every state in the union but as a more
concise and at the same time equally satisfactory evidence i
will refer to the example of two states attested by two
unexceptionable authorities the first example is that of
virginia a state which as we have seen has expressly declared
in its constitution that the three great departments ought not
to be intermixed the authority in support of it is mr
jefferson who besides his other advantages for remarking the
operation of the government was himself the chief magistrate of
it in order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience
had impressed him on this subject it will be necessary to quote
a passage of some length from his very interesting notes on the
state of virginia p  all the powers of government
legislative executive and judiciary result to the legislative
body the concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the
definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation
that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands and
not by a single one one hundred and seventythree despots would
surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn
their eyes on the republic of venice as little will it avail us
that they are chosen by ourselves an elective despotism was not
the government we fought for but one which should not only be
founded on free principles but in which the powers of government
should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of
magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits
without being effectually checked and restrained by the others
for this reason that convention which passed the ordinance of
government laid its foundation on this basis that the
legislative executive and judiciary departments should be
separate and distinct so that no person should exercise the
powers of more than one of them at the same time but no barrier
was provided between these several powers the judiciary and the
executive members were left dependent on the legislative for
their subsistence in office and some of them for their
continuance in it if therefore the legislature assumes
executive and judiciary powers no opposition is likely to be
made nor if made can be effectual because in that case they
may put their proceedings into the form of acts of assembly
which will render them obligatory on the other branches they
have accordingly in many instances decided rights which should
have been left to judiciary controversy and the direction of the
executive during the whole time of their session is becoming
habitual and familiar the other state which i shall take for
an example is pennsylvania and the other authority the council
of censors which assembled in the years  and  a part of
the duty of this body as marked out by the constitution was
to inquire whether the constitution had been preserved
inviolate in every part and whether the legislative and
executive branches of government had performed their duty as
guardians of the people or assumed to themselves or exercised
other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the
constitution  in the execution of this trust the council were
necessarily led to a comparison of both the legislative and
executive proceedings with the constitutional powers of these
departments and from the facts enumerated and to the truth of
most of which both sides in the council subscribed it appears
that the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the
legislature in a variety of important instances a great number
of laws had been passed violating without any apparent
necessity the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature
shall be previously printed for the consideration of the people
although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the
constitution against improper acts of legislature the
constitutional trial by jury had been violated and powers
assumed which had not been delegated by the constitution
executive powers had been usurped the salaries of the judges
which the constitution expressly requires to be fixed had been
occasionally varied and cases belonging to the judiciary
department frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and
determination those who wish to see the several particulars
falling under each of these heads may consult the journals of
the council which are in print some of them it will be found
may be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected with the
war but the greater part of them may be considered as the
spontaneous shoots of an illconstituted government it appears
also that the executive department had not been innocent of
frequent breaches of the constitution there are three
observations however which ought to be made on this head
first a great proportion of the instances were either
immediately produced by the necessities of the war or
recommended by congress or the commanderinchief secondly in
most of the other instances they conformed either to the
declared or the known sentiments of the legislative department
thirdly the executive department of pennsylvania is
distinguished from that of the other states by the number of
members composing it in this respect it has as much affinity
to a legislative assembly as to an executive council and being
at once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility
for the acts of the body and deriving confidence from mutual
example and joint influence unauthorized measures would of
course be more freely hazarded than where the executive
department is administered by a single hand or by a few hands
the conclusion which i am warranted in drawing from these
observations is that a mere demarcation on parchment of the
constitutional limits of the several departments is not a
sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a
tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the
same hands publius 
federalist no 
method of guarding against the encroachments of any one
department of government by appealing to the people through a
convention
from the new york packet tuesday february   
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
the author of the notes on the state of virginia quoted in
the last paper has subjoined to that valuable work the draught
of a constitution which had been prepared in order to be laid
before a convention expected to be called in  by the
legislature for the establishment of a constitution for that
commonwealth the plan like every thing from the same pen marks
a turn of thinking original comprehensive and accurate and is
the more worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent
attachment to republican government and an enlightened view of
the dangerous propensities against which it ought to be guarded
one of the precautions which he proposes and on which he appears
ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of
power against the invasions of the stronger is perhaps
altogether his own and as it immediately relates to the subject
of our present inquiry ought not to be overlooked his
proposition is that whenever any two of the three branches of
government shall concur in opinion each by the voices of two
thirds of their whole number that a convention is necessary for
altering the constitution or correcting breaches of it a
convention shall be called for the purpose as the people are
the only legitimate fountain of power and it is from them that
the constitutional charter under which the several branches of
government hold their power is derived it seems strictly
consonant to the republican theory to recur to the same original
authority not only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge
diminish or newmodel the powers of the government but also
whenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on
the chartered authorities of the others the several departments
being perfectly coordinate by the terms of their common
commission none of them it is evident can pretend to an
exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between
their respective powers and how are the encroachments of the
stronger to be prevented or the wrongs of the weaker to be
redressed without an appeal to the people themselves who as
the grantors of the commissions can alone declare its true
meaning and enforce its observance there is certainly great
force in this reasoning and it must be allowed to prove that a
constitutional road to the decision of the people ought to be
marked out and kept open for certain great and extraordinary
occasions but there appear to be insuperable objections against
the proposed recurrence to the people as a provision in all
cases for keeping the several departments of power within their
constitutional limits in the first place the provision does not
reach the case of a combination of two of the departments against
the third if the legislative authority which possesses so many
means of operating on the motives of the other departments
should be able to gain to its interest either of the others or
even one third of its members the remaining department could
derive no advantage from its remedial provision i do not dwell
however on this objection because it may be thought to be
rather against the modification of the principle than against
the principle itself in the next place it may be considered as
an objection inherent in the principle that as every appeal to
the people would carry an implication of some defect in the
government frequent appeals would in a great measure deprive
the government of that veneration which time bestows on every
thing and without which perhaps the wisest and freest
governments would not possess the requisite stability if it be
true that all governments rest on opinion it is no less true
that the strength of opinion in each individual and its
practical influence on his conduct depend much on the number
which he supposes to have entertained the same opinion the
reason of man like man himself is timid and cautious when left
alone and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the
number with which it is associated when the examples which
fortify opinion are ancient as well as numerous they are known
to have a double effect in a nation of philosophers this
consideration ought to be disregarded a reverence for the laws
would be sufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened
reason but a nation of philosophers is as little to be expected
as the philosophical race of kings wished for by plato and in
every other nation the most rational government will not find it
a superfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community
on its side the danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by
interesting too strongly the public passions is a still more
serious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional
questions to the decision of the whole society notwithstanding
the success which has attended the revisions of our established
forms of government and which does so much honor to the virtue
and intelligence of the people of america it must be confessed
that the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be
unnecessarily multiplied we are to recollect that all the
existing constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which
repressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord of
an enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic
leaders which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on
great national questions of a universal ardor for new and
opposite forms produced by a universal resentment and
indignation against the ancient government and whilst no spirit
of party connected with the changes to be made or the abuses to
be reformed could mingle its leaven in the operation the future
situations in which we must expect to be usually placed do not
present any equivalent security against the danger which is
apprehended but the greatest objection of all is that the
decisions which would probably result from such appeals would not
answer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional equilibrium
of the government we have seen that the tendency of republican
governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the
expense of the other departments the appeals to the people
therefore would usually be made by the executive and judiciary
departments but whether made by one side or the other would
each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial let us view their
different situations the members of the executive and judiciary
departments are few in number and can be personally known to a
small part only of the people the latter by the mode of their
appointment as well as by the nature and permanency of it are
too far removed from the people to share much in their
prepossessions the former are generally the objects of jealousy
and their administration is always liable to be discolored and
rendered unpopular the members of the legislative department on
the other hand are numberous they are distributed and dwell
among the people at large their connections of blood of
friendship and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the
most influential part of the society the nature of their public
trust implies a personal influence among the people and that
they are more immediately the confidential guardians of the
rights and liberties of the people with these advantages it can
hardly be supposed that the adverse party would have an equal
chance for a favorable issue but the legislative party would not
only be able to plead their cause most successfully with the
people they would probably be constituted themselves the judges
the same influence which had gained them an election into the
legislature would gain them a seat in the convention if this
should not be the case with all it would probably be the case
with many and pretty certainly with those leading characters on
whom every thing depends in such bodies the convention in
short would be composed chiefly of men who had been who
actually were or who expected to be members of the department
whose conduct was arraigned they would consequently be parties
to the very question to be decided by them it might however
sometimes happen that appeals would be made under circumstances
less adverse to the executive and judiciary departments the
usurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so
sudden as to admit of no specious coloring a strong party
among themselves might take side with the other branches the
executive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of
the people in such a posture of things the public decision
might be less swayed by prepossessions in favor of the
legislative party but still it could never be expected to turn
on the true merits of the question it would inevitably be
connected with the spirit of preexisting parties or of parties
springing out of the question itself it would be connected with
persons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the
community it would be pronounced by the very men who had been
agents in or opponents of the measures to which the decision
would relate the passions therefore not the reason of the
public would sit in judgment but it is the reason alone of the
public that ought to control and regulate the government the
passions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government
we found in the last paper that mere declarations in the written
constitution are not sufficient to restrain the several
departments within their legal rights it appears in this that
occasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an
effectual provision for that purpose how far the provisions of a
different nature contained in the plan above quoted might be
adequate i do not examine some of them are unquestionably
founded on sound political principles and all of them are framed
with singular ingenuity and precision publius 
federalist no 
periodical appeals to the people considered
from the new york packet tuesday february   
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
it may be contended perhaps that instead of occasional appeals
to the people which are liable to the objections urged against
them periodical appeals are the proper and adequate means of
preventing and correcting infractions of the constitution it
will be attended to that in the examination of these expedients
i confine myself to their aptitude for enforcing the
constitution by keeping the several departments of power within
their due bounds without particularly considering them as
provisions for altering the constitution itself in the first
view appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be nearly
as ineligible as appeals on particular occasions as they emerge
if the periods be separated by short intervals the measures to
be reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date and will
be connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and
pervert the result of occasional revisions if the periods be
distant from each other the same remark will be applicable to
all recent measures and in proportion as the remoteness of the
others may favor a dispassionate review of them this advantage
is inseparable from inconveniences which seem to counterbalance
it in the first place a distant prospect of public censure
would be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to
which it might be urged by the force of present motives is it to
be imagined that a legislative assembly consisting of a hundred
or two hundred members eagerly bent on some favorite object and
breaking through the restraints of the constitution in pursuit of
it would be arrested in their career by considerations drawn
from a censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance
of ten fifteen or twenty years in the next place the abuses
would often have completed their mischievous effects before the
remedial provision would be applied and in the last place where
this might not be the case they would be of long standing would
have taken deep root and would not easily be extirpated the
scheme of revising the constitution in order to correct recent
breaches of it as well as for other purposes has been actually
tried in one of the states one of the objects of the council of
censors which met in pennsylvania in  and  was as we
have seen to inquire whether the constitution had been
violated and whether the legislative and executive departments
had encroached upon each other  this important and novel
experiment in politics merits in several points of view very
particular attention in some of them it may perhaps as a
single experiment made under circumstances somewhat peculiar be
thought to be not absolutely conclusive but as applied to the
case under consideration it involves some facts which i venture
to remark as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the
reasoning which i have employed first it appears from the
names of the gentlemen who composed the council that some at
least of its most active members had also been active and
leading characters in the parties which preexisted in the state
secondly it appears that the same active and leading members of
the council had been active and influential members of the
legislative and executive branches within the period to be
reviewed and even patrons or opponents of the very measures to
be thus brought to the test of the constitution two of the
members had been vicepresidents of the state and several other
members of the executive council within the seven preceding
years one of them had been speaker and a number of others
distinguished members of the legislative assembly within the
same period thirdly every page of their proceedings witnesses
the effect of all these circumstances on the temper of their
deliberations throughout the continuance of the council it was
split into two fixed and violent parties the fact is
acknowledged and lamented by themselves had this not been the
case the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally
satisfactory in all questions however unimportant in
themselves or unconnected with each other the same names stand
invariably contrasted on the opposite columns every unbiased
observer may infer without danger of mistake and at the same
time without meaning to reflect on either party or any
individuals of either party that unfortunately passion not
reason must have presided over their decisions when men
exercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety of distinct
questions they inevitably fall into different opinions on some
of them when they are governed by a common passion their
opinions if they are so to be called will be the same
fourthly it is at least problematical whether the decisions of
this body do not in several instances misconstrue the limits
prescribed for the legislative and executive departments instead
of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places
fifthly i have never understood that the decisions of the
council on constitutional questions whether rightly or
erroneously formed have had any effect in varying the practice
founded on legislative constructions it even appears if i
mistake not that in one instance the contemporary legislature
denied the constructions of the council and actually prevailed
in the contest this censorial body therefore proves at the
same time by its researches the existence of the disease and
by its example the inefficacy of the remedy this conclusion
cannot be invalidated by alleging that the state in which the
experiment was made was at that crisis and had been for a long
time before violently heated and distracted by the rage of
party is it to be presumed that at any future septennial epoch
the same state will be free from parties is it to be presumed
that any other state at the same or any other given period will
be exempt from them such an event ought to be neither presumed
nor desired because an extinction of parties necessarily implies
either a universal alarm for the public safety or an absolute
extinction of liberty were the precaution taken of excluding
from the assemblies elected by the people to revise the
preceding administration of the government all persons who
should have been concerned with the government within the given
period the difficulties would not be obviated the important
task would probably devolve on men who with inferior
capacities would in other respects be little better qualified
although they might not have been personally concerned in the
administration and therefore not immediately agents in the
measures to be examined they would probably have been involved
in the parties connected with these measures and have been
elected under their auspices publius

the structure of the government must furnish the proper checks
and balances between the different departments
from the new york packet friday february   
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
to what expedient then shall we finally resort for maintaining
in practice the necessary partition of power among the several
departments as laid down in the constitution the only answer
that can be given is that as all these exterior provisions are
found to be inadequate the defect must be supplied by so
contriving the interior structure of the government as that its
several constituent parts may by their mutual relations be the
means of keeping each other in their proper places without
presuming to undertake a full development of this important idea
i will hazard a few general observations which may perhaps place
it in a clearer light and enable us to form a more correct
judgment of the principles and structure of the government
planned by the convention in order to lay a due foundation for
that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of
government which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to
be essential to the preservation of liberty it is evident that
each department should have a will of its own and consequently
should be so constituted that the members of each should have as
little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of
the others were this principle rigorously adhered to it would
require that all the appointments for the supreme executive
legislative and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the
same fountain of authority the people through channels having
no communication whatever with one another perhaps such a plan
of constructing the several departments would be less difficult
in practice than it may in contemplation appear some
difficulties however and some additional expense would attend
the execution of it some deviations therefore from the
principle must be admitted in the constitution of the judiciary
department in particular it might be inexpedient to insist
rigorously on the principle first because peculiar
qualifications being essential in the members the primary
consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which
best secures these qualifications secondly because the
permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that
department must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the
authority conferring them it is equally evident that the
members of each department should be as little dependent as
possible on those of the others for the emoluments annexed to
their offices were the executive magistrate or the judges not
independent of the legislature in this particular their
independence in every other would be merely nominal but the
great security against a gradual concentration of the several
powers in the same department consists in giving to those who
administer each department the necessary constitutional means and
personal motives to resist encroachments of the others the
provision for defense must in this as in all other cases be
made commensurate to the danger of attack ambition must be made
to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be
connected with the constitutional rights of the place it may be
a reflection on human nature that such devices should be
necessary to control the abuses of government but what is
government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human
nature if men were angels no government would be necessary if
angels were to govern men neither external nor internal
controls on government would be necessary in framing a
government which is to be administered by men over men the great
difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to
control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control
itself a dependence on the people is no doubt the primary
control on the government but experience has taught mankind the
necessity of auxiliary precautions this policy of supplying by
opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives might
be traced through the whole system of human affairs private as
well as public we see it particularly displayed in all the
subordinate distributions of power where the constant aim is to
divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that
each may be a check on the other that the private interest of
every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights these
inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the
distribution of the supreme powers of the state but it is not
possible to give to each department an equal power of
selfdefense in republican government the legislative
authority necessarily predominates the remedy for this
inconveniency is to divide the legislature into different
branches and to render them by different modes of election and
different principles of action as little connected with each
other as the nature of their common functions and their common
dependence on the society will admit it may even be necessary
to guard against dangerous encroachments by still further
precautions as the weight of the legislative authority requires
that it should be thus divided the weakness of the executive may
require on the other hand that it should be fortified an
absolute negative on the legislature appears at first view to
be the natural defense with which the executive magistrate should
be armed but perhaps it would be neither altogether safe nor
alone sufficient on ordinary occasions it might not be exerted
with the requisite firmness and on extraordinary occasions it
might be perfidiously abused may not this defect of an absolute
negative be supplied by some qualified connection between this
weaker department and the weaker branch of the stronger
department by which the latter may be led to support the
constitutional rights of the former without being too much
detached from the rights of its own department if the principles
on which these observations are founded be just as i persuade
myself they are and they be applied as a criterion to the
several state constitutions and to the federal constitution it
will be found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond
with them the former are infinitely less able to bear such a
test there are moreover two considerations particularly
applicable to the federal system of america which place that
system in a very interesting point of view first in a single
republic all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to
the administration of a single government and the usurpations
are guarded against by a division of the government into distinct
and separate departments in the compound republic of america
the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two
distinct governments and then the portion allotted to each
subdivided among distinct and separate departments hence a
double security arises to the rights of the people the different
governments will control each other at the same time that each
will be controlled by itself second it is of great importance
in a republic not only to guard the society against the
oppression of its rulers but to guard one part of the society
against the injustice of the other part different interests
necessarily exist in different classes of citizens if a
majority be united by a common interest the rights of the
minority will be insecure there are but two methods of
providing against this evil the one by creating a will in the
community independent of the majority that is of the society
itself the other by comprehending in the society so many
separate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust
combination of a majority of the whole very improbable if not
impracticable the first method prevails in all governments
possessing an hereditary or selfappointed authority this at
best is but a precarious security because a power independent
of the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major
as the rightful interests of the minor party and may possibly be
turned against both parties the second method will be
exemplified in the federal republic of the united states whilst
all authority in it will be derived from and dependent on the
society the society itself will be broken into so many parts
interests and classes of citizens that the rights of
individuals or of the minority will be in little danger from
interested combinations of the majority in a free government
the security for civil rights must be the same as that for
religious rights it consists in the one case in the
multiplicity of interests and in the other in the multiplicity
of sects the degree of security in both cases will depend on
the number of interests and sects and this may be presumed to
depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended
under the same government this view of the subject must
particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere
and considerate friends of republican government since it shows
that in exact proportion as the territory of the union may be
formed into more circumscribed confederacies or states
oppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated the
best security under the republican forms for the rights of
every class of citizens will be diminished and consequently the
stability and independence of some member of the government the
only other security must be proportionately increased justice
is the end of government it is the end of civil society it
ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained or
until liberty be lost in the pursuit in a society under the
forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress
the weaker anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state
of nature where the weaker individual is not secured against the
violence of the stronger and as in the latter state even the
stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their
condition to submit to a government which may protect the weak
as well as themselves so in the former state will the more
powerful factions or parties be gradnally induced by a like
motive to wish for a government which will protect all parties
the weaker as well as the more powerful it can be little
doubted that if the state of rhode island was separated from the
confederacy and left to itself the insecurity of rights under
the popular form of government within such narrow limits would be
displayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities
that some power altogether independent of the people would soon
be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had
proved the necessity of it in the extended republic of the
united states and among the great variety of interests parties
and sects which it embraces a coalition of a majority of the
whole society could seldom take place on any other principles
than those of justice and the general good whilst there being
thus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party there
must be less pretext also to provide for the security of the
former by introducing into the government a will not dependent
on the latter or in other words a will independent of the
society itself it is no less certain than it is important
notwithstanding the contrary opinions which have been
entertained that the larger the society provided it lie within
a practical sphere the more duly capable it will be of
selfgovernment and happily for the republican cause the
practicable sphere may be carried to a very great extent by a
judicious modification and mixture of the federal principle

the house of representatives
from the new york packet friday february   
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
from the more general inquiries pursued in the four last papers
i pass on to a more particular examination of the several parts
of the government i shall begin with the house of
representatives the first view to be taken of this part of the
government relates to the qualifications of the electors and the
elected those of the former are to be the same with those of the
electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures
the definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded
as a fundamental article of republican government it was
incumbent on the convention therefore to define and establish
this right in the constitution to have left it open for the
occasional regulation of the congress would have been improper
for the reason just mentioned to have submitted it to the
legislative discretion of the states would have been improper
for the same reason and for the additional reason that it would
have rendered too dependent on the state governments that branch
of the federal government which ought to be dependent on the
people alone to have reduced the different qualifications in the
different states to one uniform rule would probably have been as
dissatisfactory to some of the states as it would have been
difficult to the convention the provision made by the convention
appears therefore to be the best that lay within their option
it must be satisfactory to every state because it is conformable
to the standard already established or which may be established
by the state itself it will be safe to the united states
because being fixed by the state constitutions it is not
alterable by the state governments and it cannot be feared that
the people of the states will alter this part of their
constitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured
to them by the federal constitution the qualifications of the
elected being less carefully and properly defined by the state
constitutions and being at the same time more susceptible of
uniformity have been very properly considered and regulated by
the convention a representative of the united states must be of
the age of twentyfive years must have been seven years a
citizen of the united states must at the time of his election
be an inhabitant of the state he is to represent and during the
time of his service must be in no office under the united
states under these reasonable limitations the door of this part
of the federal government is open to merit of every description
whether native or adoptive whether young or old and without
regard to poverty or wealth or to any particular profession of
religious faith the term for which the representatives are to be
elected falls under a second view which may be taken of this
branch in order to decide on the propriety of this article two
questions must be considered first whether biennial elections
will in this case be safe secondly whether they be necessary
or useful first as it is essential to liberty that the
government in general should have a common interest with the
people so it is particularly essential that the branch of it
under consideration should have an immediate dependence on and
an intimate sympathy with the people frequent elections are
unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and
sympathy can be effectually secured but what particular degree
of frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose does
not appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation and must
depend on a variety of circumstances with which it may be
connected let us consult experience the guide that ought always
to be followed whenever it can be found the scheme of
representation as a substitute for a meeting of the citizens in
person being at most but very imperfectly known to ancient
polity it is in more modern times only that we are to expect
instructive examples and even here in order to avoid a research
too vague and diffusive it will be proper to confine ourselves
to the few examples which are best known and which bear the
greatest analogy to our particular case the first to which this
character ought to be applied is the house of commons in great
britain the history of this branch of the english constitution
anterior to the date of magna charta is too obscure to yield
instruction the very existence of it has been made a question
among political antiquaries the earliest records of subsequent
date prove that parliaments were to sit only every year not that
they were to be elected every year and even these annual
sessions were left so much at the discretion of the monarch
that under various pretexts very long and dangerous
intermissions were often contrived by royal ambition to remedy
this grievance it was provided by a statute in the reign of
charles ii  that the intermissions should not be protracted
beyond a period of three years on the accession of william iii
 when a revolution took place in the government the subject was
still more seriously resumed and it was declared to be among the
fundamental rights of the people that parliaments ought to be
held frequently by another statute which passed a few years
later in the same reign the term frequently which had
alluded to the triennial period settled in the time of charles
ii  is reduced to a precise meaning it being expressly enacted
that a new parliament shall be called within three years after
the termination of the former the last change from three to
seven years is well known to have been introduced pretty early
in the present century under on alarm for the hanoverian
succession from these facts it appears that the greatest
frequency of elections which has been deemed necessary in that
kingdom for binding the representatives to their constituents
does not exceed a triennial return of them and if we may argue
from the degree of liberty retained even under septennial
elections and all the other vicious ingredients in the
parliamentary constitution we cannot doubt that a reduction of
the period from seven to three years with the other necessary
reforms would so far extend the influence of the people over
their representatives as to satisfy us that biennial elections
under the federal system cannot possibly be dangerous to the
requisite dependence of the house of representatives on their
constituents elections in ireland till of late were regulated
entirely by the discretion of the crown and were seldom
repeated except on the accession of a new prince or some other
contingent event the parliament which commenced with george ii
was continued throughout his whole reign a period of about
thirtyfive years the only dependence of the representatives on
the people consisted in the right of the latter to supply
occasional vacancies by the election of new members and in the
chance of some event which might produce a general new election
the ability also of the irish parliament to maintain the rights
of their constituents so far as the disposition might exist was
extremely shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects
of their deliberation of late these shackles if i mistake not
have been broken and octennial parliaments have besides been
established what effect may be produced by this partial reform
must be left to further experience the example of ireland from
this view of it can throw but little light on the subject as
far as we can draw any conclusion from it it must be that if the
people of that country have been able under all these
disadvantages to retain any liberty whatever the advantage of
biennial elections would secure to them every degree of liberty
which might depend on a due connection between their
representatives and themselves let us bring our inquiries nearer
home the example of these states when british colonies claims
particular attention at the same time that it is so well known
as to require little to be said on it the principle of
representation in one branch of the legislature at least was
established in all of them but the periods of election were
different they varied from one to seven years have we any
reason to infer from the spirit and conduct of the
representatives of the people prior to the revolution that
biennial elections would have been dangerous to the public
liberties the spirit which everywhere displayed itself at the
commencement of the struggle and which vanquished the obstacles
to independence is the best of proofs that a sufficient portion
of liberty had been everywhere enjoyed to inspire both a sense of
its worth and a zeal for its proper enlargement this remark holds
good as well with regard to the then colonies whose elections
were least frequent as to those whose elections were most
frequent virginia was the colony which stood first in resisting
the parliamentary usurpations of great britain it was the first
also in espousing by public act the resolution of independence
in virginia nevertheless if i have not been misinformed
elections under the former government were septennial this
particular example is brought into view not as a proof of any
peculiar merit for the priority in those instances was probably
accidental and still less of any advantage in septennial
elections for when compared with a greater frequency they are
inadmissible but merely as a proof and i conceive it to be a
very substantial proof that the liberties of the people can be
in no danger from biennial elections the conclusion resulting
from these examples will be not a little strengthened by
recollecting three circumstances the first is that the federal
legislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative
authority which is vested completely in the british parliament
and which with a few exceptions was exercised by the colonial
assemblies and the irish legislature it is a received and
wellfounded maxim that where no other circumstances affect the
case the greater the power is the shorter ought to be its
duration and conversely the smaller the power the more safely
may its duration be protracted in the second place it has on
another occasion been shown that the federal legislature will
not only be restrained by its dependence on its people as other
legislative bodies are but that it will be moreover watched
and controlled by the several collateral legislatures which
other legislative bodies are not and in the third place no
comparison can be made between the means that will be possessed
by the more permanent branches of the federal government for
seducing if they should be disposed to seduce the house of
representatives from their duty to the people and the means of
influence over the popular branch possessed by the other branches
of the government above cited with less power therefore to
abuse the federal representatives can be less tempted on one
side and will be doubly watched on the other publius

the same subject continuedthe house of representatives

i shall here perhaps be reminded of a current observation
that where annual elections end tyranny begins  if it be
true as has often been remarked that sayings which become
proverbial are generally founded in reason it is not less true
that when once established they are often applied to cases to
which the reason of them does not extend i need not look for a
proof beyond the case before us what is the reason on which this
proverbial observation is founded no man will subject himself to
the ridicule of pretending that any natural connection subsists
between the sun or the seasons and the period within which human
virtue can bear the temptations of power happily for mankind
liberty is not in this respect confined to any single point of
time but lies within extremes which afford sufficient latitude
for all the variations which may be required by the various
situations and circumstances of civil society the election of
magistrates might be if it were found expedient as in some
instances it actually has been daily weekly or monthly as
well as annual and if circumstances may require a deviation from
the rule on one side why not also on the other side turning our
attention to the periods established among ourselves for the
election of the most numerous branches of the state legislatures
we find them by no means coinciding any more in this instance
than in the elections of other civil magistrates in connecticut
and rhode island the periods are halfyearly in the other
states south carolina excepted they are annual in south
carolina they are biennial as is proposed in the federal
government here is a difference as four to one between the
longest and shortest periods and yet it would be not easy to
show that connecticut or rhode island is better governed or
enjoys a greater share of rational liberty than south carolina
or that either the one or the other of these states is
distinguished in these respects and by these causes from the
states whose elections are different from both in searching for
the grounds of this doctrine i can discover but one and that is
wholly inapplicable to our case the important distinction so
well understood in america between a constitution established by
the people and unalterable by the government and a law
established by the government and alterable by the government
seems to have been little understood and less observed in any
other country wherever the supreme power of legislation has
resided has been supposed to reside also a full power to change
the form of the government even in great britain where the
principles of political and civil liberty have been most
discussed and where we hear most of the rights of the
constitution it is maintained that the authority of the
parliament is transcendent and uncontrollable as well with
regard to the constitution as the ordinary objects of
legislative provision they have accordingly in several
instances actually changed by legislative acts some of the
most fundamental articles of the government they have in
particular on several occasions changed the period of election
and on the last occasion not only introduced septennial in
place of triennial elections but by the same act continued
themselves in place four years beyond the term for which they
were elected by the people an attention to these dangerous
practices has produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of
free government of which frequency of elections is the
cornerstone and has led them to seek for some security to
liberty against the danger to which it is exposed where no
constitution paramount to the government either existed or
could be obtained no constitutional security similar to that
established in the united states was to be attempted some
other security therefore was to be sought for and what better
security would the case admit than that of selecting and
appealing to some simple and familiar portion of time as a
standard for measuring the danger of innovations for fixing the
national sentiment and for uniting the patriotic exertions the
most simple and familiar portion of time applicable to the
subject was that of a year and hence the doctrine has been
inculcated by a laudable zeal to erect some barrier against the
gradual innovations of an unlimited government that the advance
towards tyranny was to be calculated by the distance of departure
from the fixed point of annual elections but what necessity can
there be of applying this expedient to a government limited as
the federal government will be by the authority of a paramount
constitution or who will pretend that the liberties of the
people of america will not be more secure under biennial
elections unalterably fixed by such a constitution than those
of any other nation would be where elections were annual or
even more frequent but subject to alterations by the ordinary
power of the government the second question stated is whether
biennial elections be necessary or useful the propriety of
answering this question in the affirmative will appear from
several very obvious considerations                             
                                         no man can be a
competent legislator who does not add to an upright intention and
a sound judgment a certain degree of knowledge of the subjects on
which he is to legislate a part of this knowledge may be
acquired by means of information which lie within the compass of
men in private as well as public stations another part can only
be attained or at least thoroughly attained by actual
experience in the station which requires the use of it the
period of service ought therefore in all such cases to bear
some proportion to the extent of practical knowledge requisite to
the due performance of the service the period of legislative
service established in most of the states for the more numerous
branch is as we have seen one year the question then may be
put into this simple form does the period of two years bear no
greater proportion to the knowledge requisite for federal
legislation than one year does to the knowledge requisite for
state legislation the very statement of the question in this
form suggests the answer that ought to be given to it in a
single state the requisite knowledge relates to the existing
laws which are uniform throughout the state and with which all
the citizens are more or less conversant and to the general
affairs of the state which lie within a small compass are not
very diversified and occupy much of the attention and
conversation of every class of people the great theatre of the
united states presents a very different scene the laws are so
far from being uniform that they vary in every state whilst the
public affairs of the union are spread throughout a very
extensive region and are extremely diversified by t e local
affairs connected with them and can with difficulty be correctly
learnt in any other place than in the central councils to which a
knowledge of them will be brought by the representatives of every
part of the empire yet some knowledge of the affairs and even
of the laws of all the states ought to be possessed by the
members from each of the states how can foreign trade be
properly regulated by uniform laws without some acquaintance
with the commerce the ports the usages and the regulatious of
the different states how can the trade between the different
states be duly regulated without some knowledge of their
relative situations in these and other respects how can taxes
be judiciously imposed and effectually collected if they be not
accommodated to the different laws and local circumstances
relating to these objects in the different states how can
uniform regulations for the militia be duly provided without a
similar knowledge of many internal circumstances by which the
states are distinguished from each other these are the
principal objects of federal legislation and suggest most
forcibly the extensive information which the representatives
ought to acquire the other interior objects will require a
proportional degree of information with regard to them it is
true that all these difficulties will by degrees be very much
diminished the most laborious task will be the proper
inauguration of the government and the primeval formation of a
federal code improvements on the first draughts will every year
become both easier and fewer past transactions of the
government will be a ready and accurate source of information to
new members the affairs of the union will become more and more
objects of curiosity and conversation among the citizens at
large and the increased intercourse among those of different
states will contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual knowledge
of their affairs as this again will contribute to a general
assimilation of their manners and laws but with all these
abatements the business of federal legislation must continue so
far to exceed both in novelty and difficulty the legislative
business of a single state as to justify the longer period of
service assigned to those who are to transact it a branch of
knowledge which belongs to the acquirements of a federal
representative and which has not been mentioned is that of
foreign affairs in regulating our own commerce he ought to be
not only acquainted with the treaties between the united states
and other nations but also with the commercial policy and laws
of other nations he ought not to be altogether ignorant of the
law of nations for that as far as it is a proper object of
municipal legislation is submitted to the federal government
and although the house of representatives is not immediately to
participate in foreign negotiations and arrangements yet from
the necessary connection between the several branches of public
affairs those particular branches will frequently deserve
attention in the ordinary course of legislation and will
sometimes demand particular legislative sanction and
cooperation some portion of this knowledge may no doubt be
acquired in a mans closet but some of it also can only be
derived from the public sources of information and all of it
will be acquired to best effect by a practical attention to the
subject during the period of actual service in the legislature
there are other considerations of less importance perhaps but
which are not unworthy of notice the distance which many of the
representatives will be obliged to travel and the arrangements
rendered necessary by that circumstance might be much more
serious objections with fit men to this service if limited to a
single year than if extended to two years no argument can be
drawn on this subject from the case of the delegates to the
existing congress they are elected annually it is true but
their reelection is considered by the legislative assemblies
almost as a matter of course the election of the representatives
by the people would not be governed by the same principle a few
of the members as happens in all such assemblies will possess
superior talents will by frequent reelections become members
of long standing will be thoroughly masters of the public
business and perhaps not unwilling to avail themselves of those
advantages the greater the proportion of new members and the
less the information of the bulk of the members the more apt will
they be to fall into the snares that may be laid for them this
remark is no less applicable to the relation which will subsist
between the house of representatives and the senate it is an
inconvenience mingled with the advantages of our frequent
elections even in single states where they are large and hold
but one legislative session in a year that spurious elections
cannot be investigated and annulled in time for the decision to
have its due effect if a return can be obtained no matter by
what unlawful means the irregular member who takes his seat of
course is sure of holding it a sufficient time to answer his
purposes hence a very pernicious encouragement is given to the
use of unlawful means for obtaining irregular returns were
elections for the federal legislature to be annual this practice
might become a very serious abuse particularly in the more
distant states each house is as it necessarily must be the
judge of the elections qualifications and returns of its
members and whatever improvements may be suggested by
experience for simplifying and accelerating the process in
disputed cases so great a portion of a year would unavoidably
elapse before an illegitimate member could be dispossessed of
his seat that the prospect of such an event would be little
check to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a seat all these
considerations taken together warrant us in affirming that
biennial elections will be as useful to the affairs of the public

the apportionment of members among the states
from the new york packet tuesday february   
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
the next view which i shall take of the house of representatives
relates to the appointment of its members to the several states
which is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct
taxes                                                           
           it is not contended that the number of people in each
state ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion
of those who are to represent the people of each state the
establishment of the same rule for the appointment of taxes will
probably be as little contested though the rule itself in this
case is by no means founded on the same principle in the former
case the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of
the people with which it has a natural and universal connection
in the latter it has reference to the proportion of wealth of
which it is in no case a precise measure and in ordinary cases a
very unfit one but notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule
as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the
states it is evidently the least objectionable among the
practicable rules and had too recently obtained the general
sanction of america not to have found a ready preference with
the convention all this is admitted it will perhaps be said
but does it follow from an admission of numbers for the measure
of representation or of slaves combined with free citizens as a
ratio of taxation that slaves ought to be included in the
numerical rule of representation slaves are considered as
property not as persons they ought therefore to be comprehended
in estimates of taxation which are founded on property and to be
excluded from representation which is regulated by a census of
persons this is the objection as i understand it stated in its
full force i shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning
which may be offered on the opposite side we subscribe to the
doctrine might one of our southern brethren observe that
representation relates more immediately to persons and taxation
more immediately to property and we join in the application of
this distinction to the case of our slaves but we must deny the
fact that slaves are considered merely as property and in no
respect whatever as persons the true state of the case is that
they partake of both these qualities being considered by our
laws in some respects as persons and in other respects as
property in being compelled to labor not for himself but for
a master in being vendible by one master to another master and
in being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty and
chastised in his body by the capricious will of another the
slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank and classed
with those irrational animals which fall under the legal
denomination of property in being protected on the other hand
in his life and in his limbs against the violence of all
others even the master of his labor and his liberty and in
being punishable himself for all violence committed against
others the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a
member of the society not as a part of the irrational creation
as a moral person not as a mere article of property the
federal constitution therefore decides with great propriety on
the case of our slaves when it views them in the mixed character
of persons and of property this is in fact their true
character it is the character bestowed on them by the laws
under which they live and it will not be denied that these are
the proper criterion because it is only under the pretext that
the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property
that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers and
it is admitted that if the laws were to restore the rights which
have been taken away the negroes could no longer be refused an
equal share of representation with the other inhabitants this
question may be placed in another light it is agreed on all
sides that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation as
they are the only proper scale of representation would the
convention have been impartial or consistent if they had
rejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants when the shares
of representation were to be calculated and inserted them on the
lists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted could
it be reasonably expected that the southern states would concur
in a system which considered their slaves in some degree as men
when burdens were to be imposed but refused to consider them in
the same light when advantages were to be conferred might not
some surprise also be expressed that those who reproach the
southern states with the barbarous policy of considering as
property a part of their human brethren should themselves
contend that the government to which all the states are to be
parties ought to consider this unfortunate race more completely
in the unnatural light of property than the very laws of which
they complain it may be replied perhaps that slaves are not
included in the estimate of representatives in any of the states
possessing them they neither vote themselves nor increase the
votes of their masters upon what principle then ought they to
be taken into the federal estimate of representation in
rejecting them altogether the constitution would in this
respect have followed the very laws which have been appealed to
as the proper guide this objection is repelled by a single
abservation it is a fundamental principle of the proposed
constitution that as the aggregate number of representatives
allotted to the several states is to be determined by a federal
rule founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants so the
right of choosing this allotted number in each state is to be
exercised by such part of the inhabitants as the state itself may
designate the qualifications on which the right of suffrage
depend are not perhaps the same in any two states in some of
the states the difference is very material in every state a
certain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by
the constitution of the state who will be included in the census
by which the federal constitution apportions the representatives
in this point of view the southern states might retort the
complaint by insisting that the principle laid down by the
convention required that no regard should be had to the policy of
particular states towards their own inhabitants and
consequently that the slaves as inhabitants should have been
admitted into the census according to their full number in like
manner with other inhabitants who by the policy of other
states are not admitted to all the rights of citizens a
rigorous adherence however to this principle is waived by
those who would be gainers by it all that they ask is that
equal moderation be shown on the other side let the case of the
slaves be considered as it is in truth a peculiar one let the
compromising expedient of the constitution be mutually adopted
which regards them as inhabitants but as debased by servitude
below the equal level of free inhabitants which regards the
slave as divested of two fifths of the man after all may not
another ground be taken on which this article of the
constitution will admit of a still more ready defense we have
hitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to
persons only and not at all to property but is it a just idea
government is instituted no less for protection of the property
than of the persons of individuals the one as well as the
other therefore may be considered as represented by those who
are charged with the government upon this principle it is that
in several of the states and particularly in the state of new
york one branch of the government is intended more especially to
be the guardian of property and is accordingly elected by that
part of the society which is most interested in this object of
government in the federal constitution this policy does not
prevail the rights of property are committed into the same hands
with the personal rights some attention ought therefore to be
paid to property in the choice of those hands for another
reason the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the
people of each state ought to bear some proportion to the
comparative wealth of the states states have not like
individuals an influence over each other arising from superior
advantages of fortune if the law allows an opulent citizen but a
single vote in the choice of his representative the respect and
consequence which he derives from his fortunate situation very
frequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his
choice and through this imperceptible channel the rights of
property are conveyed into the public representation a state
possesses no such influence over other states it is not probable
that the richest state in the confederacy will ever influence the
choice of a single representative in any other state nor will
the representatives of the larger and richer states possess any
other advantage in the federal legislature over the
representatives of other states than what may result from their
superior number alone as far therefore as their superior
wealth and weight may justly entitle them to any advantage it
ought to be secured to them by a superior share of
representation the new constitution is in this respect
materially different from the existing confederation as well as
from that of the united netherlands and other similar
confederacies in each of the latter the efficacy of the
federal resolutions depends on the subsequent and voluntary
resolutions of the states composing the union hence the states
though possessing an equal vote in the public councils have an
unequal influence corresponding with the unequal importance of
these subsequent and voluntary resolutions under the proposed
constitution the federal acts will take effect without the
necessary intervention of the individual states they will depend
merely on the majority of votes in the federal legislature and
consequently each vote whether proceeding from a larger or
smaller state or a state more or less wealthy or powerful will
have an equal weight and efficacy in the same manner as the
votes individually given in a state legislature by the
representatives of unequal counties or other districts have
each a precise equality of value and effect or if there be any
difference in the case it proceeds from the difference in the
personal character of the individual representative rather than
from any regard to the extent of the district from which he
comes such is the reasoning which an advocate for the
southern interests might employ on this subject and although it
may appear to be a little strained in some points yet on the
whole i must confess that it fully reconciles me to the scale of
representation which the convention have established in one
respect the establishment of a common measure for representation
and taxation will have a very salutary effect as the accuracy
of the census to be obtained by the congress will necessarily
depend in a considerable degree on the disposition if not on
the cooperation of the states it is of great importance that
the states should feel as little bias as possible to swell or to
reduce the amount of their numbers were their share of
representation alone to be governed by this rule they would have
an interest in exaggerating their inhabitants were the rule to
decide their share of taxation alone a contrary temptation would
prevail by extending the rule to both objects the states will
have opposite interests which will control and balance each
other and produce the requisite impartiality publius

the total number of the house of representatives
from the new york packet friday february   
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
the number of which the house of representatives is to consist
forms another and a very interesting point of view under which
this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated
scarce any article indeed in the whole constitution seems to be
rendered more worthy of attention by the weight of character and
the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed
the charges exhibited against it are first that so small a
number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the
public interests secondly that they will not possess a proper
knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous
constituents thirdly that they will be taken from that class of
citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the
mass of the people and be most likely to aim at a permanent
elevation of the few on the depression of the many fourthly
that defective as the number will be in the first instance it
will be more and more disproportionate by the increase of the
people and the obstacles which will prevent a correspondent
increase of the representatives in general it may be remarked on
this subject that no political problem is less susceptible of a
precise solution than that which relates to the number most
convenient for a representative legislature nor is there any
point on which the policy of the several states is more at
variance whether we compare their legislative assemblies
directly with each other or consider the proportions which they
respectively bear to the number of their constituents passing
over the difference between the smallest and largest states as
delaware whose most numerous branch consists of twentyone
representatives and massachusetts where it amounts to between
three and four hundred a very considerable difference is
observable among states nearly equal in population the number of
representatives in pennsylvania is not more than one fifth of
that in the state last mentioned new york whose population is
to that of south carolina as six to five has little more than
one third of the number of representatives as great a disparity
prevails between the states of georgia and delaware or rhode
island in pennsylvania the representatives do not bear a
greater proportion to their constituents than of one for every
four or five thousand in rhode island they bear a proportion of
at least one for every thousand and according to the
constitution of georgia the proportion may be carried to one to
every ten electors and must unavoidably far exceed the
proportion in any of the other states another general remark to
be made is that the ratio between the representatives and the
people ought not to be the same where the latter are very
numerous as where they are very few were the representatives in
virginia to be regulated by the standard in rhode island they
would at this time amount to between four and five hundred and
twenty or thirty years hence to a thousand on the other hand
the ratio of pennsylvania if applied to the state of delaware
would reduce the representative assembly of the latter to seven
or eight members nothing can be more fallacious than to found
our political calculations on arithmetical principles sixty or
seventy men may be more properly trusted with a given degree of
power than six or seven but it does not follow that six or seven
hundred would be proportionably a better depositary and if we
carry on the supposition to six or seven thousand the whole
reasoning ought to be reversed the truth is that in all cases a
certain number at least seems to be necessary to secure the
benefits of free consultation and discussion and to guard
against too easy a combination for improper purposes as on the
other hand the number ought at most to be kept within a certain
limit in order to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a
multitude in all very numerous assemblies of whatever character
composed passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason
had every athenian citizen been a socrates every athenian
assembly would still have been a mob                            
                                          it is necessary also to
recollect here the observations which were applied to the case of
biennial elections for the same reason that the limited powers
of the congress and the control of the state legislatures
justify less frequent elections than the public safely might
otherwise require the members of the congress need be less
numerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation
and were under no other than the ordinary restraints of other
legislative bodies with these general ideas in our mind let us
weigh the objections which have been stated against the number of
members proposed for the house of representatives it is said in
the first place that so small a number cannot be safely trusted
with so much power the number of which this branch of the
legislature is to consist at the outset of the government will
be sixtyfive within three years a census is to be taken when
the number may be augmented to one for every thirty thousand
inhabitants and within every successive period of ten years the
census is to be renewed and augmentations may continue to be
made under the above limitation it will not be thought an
extravagant conjecture that the first census will at the rate of
one for every thirty thousand raise the number of
representatives to at least one hundred estimating the negroes
in the proportion of three fifths it can scarcely be doubted
that the population of the united states will by that time if it
does not already amount to three millions at the expiration of
twentyfive years according to the computed rate of increase
the number of representatives will amount to two hundred and of
fifty years to four hundred this is a number which i presume
will put an end to all fears arising from the smallness of the
body i take for granted here what i shall in answering the
fourth objection hereafter show that the number of
representatives will be augmented from time to time in the
manner provided by the constitution on a contrary supposition i
should admit the objection to have very great weight indeed the
true question to be decided then is whether the smallness of the
number as a temporary regulation be dangerous to the public
liberty whether sixtyfive members for a few years and a
hundred or two hundred for a few more be a safe depositary for a
limited and wellguarded power of legislating for the united
states i must own that i could not give a negative answer to
this question without first obliterating every impression which
i have received with regard to the present genius of the people
of america the spirit which actuates the state legislatures and
the principles which are incorporated with the political
character of every class of citizens i am unable to conceive that
the people of america in their present temper or under any
circumstances which can speedily happen will choose and every
second year repeat the choice of sixtyfive or a hundred men who
would be disposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or
treachery i am unable to conceive that the state legislatures
which must feel so many motives to watch and which possess so
many means of counteracting the federal legislature would fail
either to detect or to defeat a conspiracy of the latter against
the liberties of their common constituents i am equally unable
to conceive that there are at this time or can be in any short
time in the united states any sixtyfive or a hundred men
capable of recommending themselves to the choice of the people at
large who would either desire or dare within the short space of
two years to betray the solemn trust committed to them what
change of circumstances time and a fuller population of our
country may produce requires a prophetic spirit to declare
which makes no part of my pretensions but judging from the
circumstances now before us and from the probable state of them
within a moderate period of time i must pronounce that the
liberties of america cannot be unsafe in the number of hands
proposed by the federal constitution from what quarter can the
danger proceed are we afraid of foreign gold if foreign gold
could so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable them to
ensnare and betray their constituents how has it happened that
we are at this time a free and independent nation the congress
which conducted us through the revolution was a less numerous
body than their successors will be they were not chosen by nor
responsible to their fellowcitizens at large though appointed
from year to year and recallable at pleasure they were
generally continued for three years and prior to the
ratification of the federal articles for a still longer term
they held their consultations always under the veil of secrecy
they had the sole transaction of our affairs with foreign
nations through the whole course of the war they had the fate of
their country more in their hands than it is to be hoped will
ever be the case with our future representatives and from the
greatness of the prize at stake and the eagerness of the party
which lost it it may well be supposed that the use of other
means than force would not have been scrupled yet we know by
happy experience that the public trust was not betrayed nor has
the purity of our public councils in this particular ever
suffered even from the whispers of calumny is the danger
apprehended from the other branches of the federal government
but where are the means to be found by the president or the
senate or both their emoluments of office it is to be
presumed will not and without a previous corruption of the
house of representatives cannot more than suffice for very
different purposes their private fortunes as they must allbe
american citizens cannot possibly be sources of danger the
only means then which they can possess will be in the
dispensation of appointments is it here that suspicion rests
her charge sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption
is to be exhausted by the president in subduing the virtue of the
senate now the fidelity of the other house is to be the
victim the improbability of such a mercenary and perfidious
combination of the several members of government standing on as
different foundations as republican principles will well admit
and at the same time accountable to the society over which they
are placed ought alone to quiet this apprehension but
fortunately the constitution has provided a still further
safeguard the members of the congress are rendered ineligible
to any civil offices that may be created or of which the
emoluments may be increased during the term of their election
no offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members but
such as may become vacant by ordinary casualties and to suppose
that these would be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the
people selected by the people themselves is to renounce every
rule by which events ought to be calculated and to substitute an
indiscriminate and unbounded jealousy with which all reasoning
must be vain the sincere friends of liberty who give
themselves up to the extravagancies of this passion are not
aware of the injury they do their own cause as there is a
degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of
circumspection and distrust so there are other qualities in
human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and
confidence republican government presupposes the existence of
these qualities in a higher degree than any other form were the
pictures which have been drawn by the political jealousy of some
among us faithful likenesses of the human character the
inference would be that there is not sufficient virtue among men
for selfgovernment and that nothing less than the chains of
despotism can restrain them from destroying and devouring one

the same subject continuedthe total number of the house of
representatives
from the new york packet tuesday february   
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
the second charge against the house of representatives is that
it will be too small to possess a due knowledge of the interests
of its constituents as this objection evidently proceeds from a
comparison of the proposed number of representatives with the
great extent of the united states the number of their
inhabitants and the diversity of their interests without taking
into view at the same time the circumstances which will
distinguish the congress from other legislative bodies the best
answer that can be given to it will be a brief explanation of
these peculiarities it is a sound and important principle that
the representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and
circumstances of his constituents but this principle can extend
no further than to those circumstances and interests to which the
authority and care of the representative relate an ignorance of
a variety of minute and particular objects which do not lie
within the compass of legislation is consistent with every
attribute necessary to a due performance of the legislative
trust in determining the extent of information required in the
exercise of a particular authority recourse then must be had to
the objects within the purview of that authority what are to be
the objects of federal legislation those which are of most
importance and which seem most to require local knowledge are
commerce taxation and the militia a proper regulation of
commerce requires much information as has been elsewhere
remarked but as far as this information relates to the laws and
local situation of each individual state a very few
representatives would be very sufficient vehicles of it to the
federal councils taxation will consist in a great measure of
duties which will be involved in the regulation of commerce so
far the preceding remark is applicable to this object as far as
it may consist of internal collections a more diffusive
knowledge of the circumstances of the state may be necessary but
will not this also be possessed in sufficient degree by a very
few intelligent men diffusively elected within the state divide
the largest state into ten or twelve districts and it will be
found that there will be no peculiar local interests in either
which will not be within the knowledge of the representative of
the district besides this source of information the laws of the
state framed by representatives from every part of it will be
almost of themselves a sufficient guide in every state there
have been made and must continue to be made regulations on this
subject which will in many cases leave little more to be done
by the federal legislature than to review the different laws
and reduce them in one general act a skillful individual in his
closet with all the local codes before him might compile a law
on some subjects of taxation for the whole union without any aid
from oral information and it may be expected that whenever
internal taxes may be necessary and particularly in cases
requiring uniformity throughout the states the more simple
objects will be preferred to be fully sensible of the facility
which will be given to this branch of federal legislation by the
assistance of the state codes we need only suppose for a moment
that this or any other state were divided into a number of parts
each having and exercising within itself a power of local
legislation is it not evident that a degree of local information
and preparatory labor would be found in the several volumes of
their proceedings which would very much shorten the labors of
the general legislature and render a much smaller number of
members sufficient for it the federal councils will derive great
advantage from another circumstance the representatives of each
state will not only bring with them a considerable knowledge of
its laws and a local knowledge of their respective districts
but will probably in all cases have been members and may even at
the very time be members of the state legislature where all the
local information and interests of the state are assembled and
from whence they may easily be conveyed by a very few hands into
the legislature of the united states the observations made on
the subject of taxation apply with greater force to the case of
the militia for however different the rules of discipline may be
in different states they are the same throughout each particular
state and depend on circumstances which can differ but little in
different parts of the same state the attentive reader will
discern that the reasoning here used to prove the sufficiency of
a moderate number of representatives does not in any respect
contradict what was urged on another occasion with regard to the
extensive information which the representatives ought to possess
and the time that might be necessary for acquiring it this
information so far as it may relate to local objects is
rendered necessary and difficult not by a difference of laws and
local circumstances within a single state but of those among
different states taking each state by itself its laws are the
same and its interests but little diversified a few men
therefore will possess all the knowledge requisite for a proper
representation of them were the interests and affairs of each
individual state perfectly simple and uniform a knowledge of
them in one part would involve a knowledge of them in every
other and the whole state might be competently represented by a
single member taken from any part of it on a comparison of the
different states together we find a great dissimilarity in their
laws and in many other circumstances connected with the objects
of federal legislation with all of which the federal
representatives ought to have some acquaintance whilst a few
representatives therefore from each state may bring with them
a due knowledge of their own state every representative will
have much information to acquire concerning all the other states
the changes of time as was formerly remarked on the comparative
situation of the different states will have an assimilating
effect the effect of time on the internal affairs of the states
taken singly will be just the contrary at present some of the
states are little more than a society of husbandmen few of them
have made much progress in those branches of industry which give
a variety and complexity to the affairs of a nation these
however will in all of them be the fruits of a more advanced
population and will require on the part of each state a fuller
representation the foresight of the convention has accordingly
taken care that the progress of population may be accompanied
with a proper increase of the representative branch of the
government the experience of great britain which presents to
mankind so many political lessons both of the monitory and
exemplary kind and which has been frequently consulted in the
course of these inquiries corroborates the result of the
reflections which we have just made the number of inhabitants in
the two kingdoms of england and scotland cannot be stated at less
than eight millions the representatives of these eight millions
in the house of commons amount to five hundred and fiftyeight
of this number one ninth are elected by three hundred and
sixtyfour persons and one half by five thousand seven hundred
and twentythree persons  it cannot be supposed that the half
thus elected and who do not even reside among the people at
large can add any thing either to the security of the people
against the government or to the knowledge of their
circumstances and interests in the legislative councils on the
contrary it is notorious that they are more frequently the
representatives and instruments of the executive magistrate than
the guardians and advocates of the popular rights they might
therefore with great propriety be considered as something more
than a mere deduction from the real representatives of the
nation we will however consider them in this light alone and
will not extend the deduction to a considerable number of
others who do not reside among their constitutents are very
faintly connected with them and have very little particular
knowledge of their affairs with all these concessions two
hundred and seventynine persons only will be the depository of
the safety interest and happiness of eight millions that is to
say there will be one representative only to maintain the rights
and explain the situation of twentyeight thousand six hundred
and seventy constitutents in an assembly exposed to the whole
force of executive influence and extending its authority to
every object of legislation within a nation whose affairs are in
the highest degree diversified and complicated yet it is very
certain not only that a valuable portion of freedom has been
preserved under all these circumstances but that the defects in
the british code are chargeable in a very small proportion on
the ignorance of the legislature concerning the circumstances of
the people allowing to this case the weight which is due to it
and comparing it with that of the house of representatives as
above explained it seems to give the fullest assurance that a
representative for every thirty thousand inhabitants will render
the latter both a safe and competent guardian of the interests

the alleged tendency of the new plan to elevate the few at the

the third charge against the house of representatives is that it
will be taken from that class of citizens which will have least
sympathy with the mass of the people and be most likely to aim
at an ambitious sacrifice of the many to the aggrandizement of
the few of all the objections which have been framed against the
federal constitution this is perhaps the most extraordinary
whilst the objection itself is levelled against a pretended
oligarchy the principle of it strikes at the very root of
republican government the aim of every political constitution
is or ought to be first to obtain for rulers men who possess
most wisdom to discern and most virtue to pursue the common
good of the society and in the next place to take the most
effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they
continue to hold their public trust the elective mode of
obtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican
government the means relied on in this form of government for
preventing their degeneracy are numerous and various the most
effectual one is such a limitation of the term of appointments
as will maintain a proper responsibility to the people let me
now ask what circumstance there is in the constitution of the
house of representatives that violates the principles of
republican government or favors the elevation of the few on the
ruins of the many let me ask whether every circumstance is not
on the contrary strictly conformable to these principles and
scrupulously impartial to the rights and pretensions of every
class and description of citizens who are to be the electors of
the federal representatives not the rich more than the poor
not the learned more than the ignorant not the haughty heirs of
distinguished names more than the humble sons of obscurity and
unpropitious fortune the electors are to be the great body of
the people of the united states they are to be the same who
exercise the right in every state of electing the corresponding
branch of the legislature of the state who are to be the objects
of popular choice every citizen whose merit may recommend him to
the esteem and confidence of his country no qualification of
wealth of birth of religious faith or of civil profession is
permitted to fetter the judgement or disappoint the inclination
of the people if we consider the situation of the men on whom
the free suffrages of their fellowcitizens may confer the
representative trust we shall find it involving every security
which can be devised or desired for their fidelity to their
constituents in the first place as they will have been
distinguished by the preference of their fellowcitizens we are
to presume that in general they will be somewhat distinguished
also by those qualities which entitle them to it and which
promise a sincere and scrupulous regard to the nature of their
engagements in the second place they will enter into the public
service under circumstances which cannot fail to produce a
temporary affection at least to their constituents there is in
every breast a sensibility to marks of honor of favor of
esteem and of confidence which apart from all considerations
of interest is some pledge for grateful and benevolent returns
ingratitude is a common topic of declamation against human
nature and it must be confessed that instances of it are but too
frequent and flagrant both in public and in private life but
the universal and extreme indignation which it inspires is itself
a proof of the energy and prevalence of the contrary sentiment
in the third place those ties which bind the representative to
his constituents are strengthened by motives of a more selfish
nature his pride and vanity attach him to a form of government
which favors his pretensions and gives him a share in its honors
and distinctions whatever hopes or projects might be entertained
by a few aspiring characters it must generally happen that a
great proportion of the men deriving their advancement from their
influence with the people would have more to hope from a
preservation of the favor than from innovations in the
government subversive of the authority of the people all these
securities however would be found very insufficient without the
restraint of frequent elections hence in the fourth place the
house of representatives is so constituted as to support in the
members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the
people before the sentiments impressed on their minds by the
mode of their elevation can be effaced by the exercise of power
they will be compelled to anticipate the moment when their power
is to cease when their exercise of it is to be reviewed and
when they must descend to the level from which they were raised
there forever to remain unless a faithful discharge of their
trust shall have established their title to a renewal of it i
will add as a fifth circumstance in the situation of the house
of representatives restraining them from oppressive measures
that they can make no law which will not have its full operation
on themselves and their friends as well as on the great mass of
the society this has always been deemed one of the strongest
bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and the people
together it creates between them that communion of interests and
sympathy of sentiments of which few governments have furnished
examples but without which every government degenerates into
tyranny if it be asked what is to restrain the house of
representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of
themselves and a particular class of the society i answer the
genius of the whole system the nature of just and constitutional
laws and above all the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates
the people of america a spirit which nourishes freedom and in
return is nourished by it if this spirit shall ever be so far
debased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature
as well as on the people the people will be prepared to tolerate
any thing but liberty such will be the relation between the
house of representatives and their constituents duty gratitude
interest ambition itself are the chords by which they will be
bound to fidelity and sympathy with the great mass of the people
it is possible that these may all be insufficient to control the
caprice and wickedness of man but are they not all that
government will admit and that human prudence can devise are
they not the genuine and the characteristic means by which
republican government provides for the liberty and happiness of
the people are they not the identical means on which every state
government in the union relies for the attainment of these
important ends what then are we to understand by the objection
which this paper has combated what are we to say to the men who
profess the most flaming zeal for republican government yet
boldly impeach the fundamental principle of it who pretend to be
champions for the right and the capacity of the people to choose
their own rulers yet maintain that they will prefer those only
who will immediately and infallibly betray the trust committed to
them were the objection to be read by one who had not seen the
mode prescribed by the constitution for the choice of
representatives he could suppose nothing less than that some
unreasonable qualification of property was annexed to the right
of suffrage or that the right of eligibility was limited to
persons of particular families or fortunes or at least that the
mode prescribed by the state constitutions was in some respect or
other very grossly departed from we have seen how far such a
supposition would err as to the two first points nor would it
in fact be less erroneous as to the last the only difference
discoverable between the two cases is that each representative
of the united states will be elected by five or six thousand
citizens whilst in the individual states the election of a
representative is left to about as many hundreds will it be
pretended that this difference is sufficient to justify an
attachment to the state governments and an abhorrence to the
federal government if this be the point on which the objection
turns it deserves to be examined is it supported by reason
this cannot be said without maintaining that five or six
thousand citizens are less capable of choosing a fit
representative or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one
than five or six hundred reason on the contrary assures us
that as in so great a number a fit representative would be most
likely to be found so the choice would be less likely to be
diverted from him by the intrigues of the ambitious or the
ambitious or the bribes of the rich is the consequence from
this doctrine admissible if we say that five or six hundred
citizens are as many as can jointly exercise their right of
suffrage must we not deprive the people of the immediate choice
of their public servants in every instance where the
administration of the government does not require as many of them
as will amount to one for that number of citizens is the
doctrine warranted by facts it was shown in the last paper that
the real representation in the british house of commons very
little exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty thousand
inhabitants besides a variety of powerful causes not existing
here and which favor in that country the pretensions of rank and
wealth no person is eligible as a representative of a county
unless he possess real estate of the clear value of six hundred
pounds sterling per year nor of a city or borough unless he
possess a like estate of half that annual value to this
qualification on the part of the county representatives is added
another on the part of the county electors which restrains the
right of suffrage to persons having a freehold estate of the
annual value of more than twenty pounds sterling according to
the present rate of money notwithstanding these unfavorable
circumstances and notwithstanding some very unequal laws in the
british code it cannot be said that the representatives of the
nation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many but we
need not resort to foreign experience on this subject our own
is explicit and decisive the districts in new hampshire in
which the senators are chosen immediately by the people are
nearly as large as will be necessary for her representatives in
the congress those of massachusetts are larger than will be
necessary for that purpose and those of new york still more so
in the last state the members of assembly for the cities and
counties of new york and albany are elected by very nearly as
many voters as will be entitled to a representative in the
congress calculating on the number of sixtyfive representatives
only it makes no difference that in these senatorial districts
and counties a number of representatives are voted for by each
elector at the same time if the same electors at the same time
are capable of choosing four or five representatives they cannot
be incapable of choosing one pennsylvania is an additional
example some of her counties which elect her state
representatives are almost as large as her districts will be by
which her federal representatives will be elected the city of
philadelphia is supposed to contain between fifty and sixty
thousand souls it will therefore form nearly two districts for
the choice of federal representatives it forms however but
one county in which every elector votes for each of its
representatives in the state legislature and what may appear to
be still more directly to our purpose the whole city actually
elects a single member for the executive council this is the
case in all the other counties of the state are not these facts
the most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been
employed against the branch of the federal government under
consideration has it appeared on trial that the senators of new
hampshire massachusetts and new york or the executive council
of pennsylvania or the members of the assembly in the two last
states have betrayed any peculiar disposition to sacrifice the
many to the few or are in any respect less worthy of their
places than the representatives and magistrates appointed in
other states by very small divisions of the people but there are
cases of a stronger complexion than any which i have yet quoted
one branch of the legislature of connecticut is so constituted
that each member of it is elected by the whole state so is the
governor of that state of massachusetts and of this state and
the president of new hampshire i leave every man to decide
whether the result of any one of these experiments can be said to
countenance a suspicion that a diffusive mode of choosing
representatives of the people tends to elevate traitors and to
undermine the public liberty publius

madison
to the people of the state of new york
the remaining charge against the house of representatives which
i am to examine is grounded on a supposition that the number of
members will not be augmented from time to time as the progress
of population may demand it has been admitted that this
objection if well supported would have great weight the
following observations will show that like most other objections
against the constitution it can only proceed from a partial view
of the subject or from a jealousy which discolors and disfigures
every object which is beheld  those who urge the objection
seem not to have recollected that the federal constitution will
not suffer by a comparison with the state constitutions in the
security provided for a gradual augmentation of the number of
representatives the number which is to prevail in the first
instance is declared to be temporary its duration is limited to
the short term of three years within every successive term of
ten years a census of inhabitants is to be repeated the
unequivocal objects of these regulations are first to readjust
from time to time the apportionment of representatives to the
number of inhabitants under the single exception that each state
shall have one representative at least secondly to augment the
number of representatives at the same periods under the sole
limitation that the whole number shall not exceed one for every
thirty thousand inhabitants if we review the constitutions of
the several states we shall find that some of them contain no
determinate regulations on this subject that others correspond
pretty much on this point with the federal constitution and that
the most effectual security in any of them is resolvable into a
mere directory provision  as far as experience has taken place
on this subject a gradual increase of representatives under the
state constitutions has at least kept pace with that of the
constituents and it appears that the former have been as ready
to concur in such measures as the latter have been to call for
them  there is a peculiarity in the federal constitution which
insures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and
of their representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the
latter the peculiarity lies in this that one branch of the
legislature is a representation of citizens the other of the
states in the former consequently the larger states will have
most weight in the latter the advantage will be in favor of the
smaller states from this circumstance it may with certainty be
inferred that the larger states will be strenuous advocates for
increasing the number and weight of that part of the legislature
in which their influence predominates and it so happens that
four only of the largest will have a majority of the whole votes
in the house of representatives should the representatives or
people therefore of the smaller states oppose at any time a
reasonable addition of members a coalition of a very few states
will be sufficient to overrule the opposition a coalition which
notwithstanding the rivalship and local prejudices which might
prevent it on ordinary occasions would not fail to take place
when not merely prompted by common interest but justified by
equity and the principles of the constitution it may be
alleged perhaps that the senate would be prompted by like
motives to an adverse coalition and as their concurrence would
be indispensable the just and constitutional views of the other
branch might be defeated this is the difficulty which has
probably created the most serious apprehensions in the jealous
friends of a numerous representation fortunately it is among
the difficulties which existing only in appearance vanish on a
close and accurate inspection the following reflections will
if i mistake not be admitted to be conclusive and satisfactory
on this point notwithstanding the equal authority which will
subsist between the two houses on all legislative subjects
except the originating of money bills it cannot be doubted that
the house composed of the greater number of members when
supported by the more powerful states and speaking the known and
determined sense of a majority of the people will have no small
advantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of
the two houses this advantage must be increased by the
consciousness felt by the same side of being supported in its
demands by right by reason and by the constitution and the
consciousness on the opposite side of contending against the
force of all these solemn considerations it is farther to be
considered that in the gradation between the smallest and
largest states there are several which though most likely in
general to arrange themselves among the former are too little
removed in extent and population from the latter to second an
opposition to their just and legitimate pretensions hence it is
by no means certain that a majority of votes even in the
senate would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number
of representatives it will not be looking too far to add that
the senators from all the new states may be gained over to the
just views of the house of representatives by an expedient too
obvious to be overlooked as these states will for a great
length of time advance in population with peculiar rapidity
they will be interested in frequent reapportionments of the
representatives to the number of inhabitants the large states
therefore who will prevail in the house of representatives will
have nothing to do but to make reapportionments and augmentations
mutually conditions of each other and the senators from all the
most growing states will be bound to contend for the latter by
the interest which their states will feel in the former these
considerations seem to afford ample security on this subject and
ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been
indulged with regard to it admitting however that they should
all be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller
states or their predominant influence in the councils of the
senate a constitutional and infallible resource still remains
with the larger states by which they will be able at all times
to accomplish their just purposes the house of representatives
cannot only refuse but they alone can propose the supplies
requisite for the support of government they in a word hold
the purse that powerful instrument by which we behold in the
history of the british constitution an infant and humble
representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of
its activity and importance and finally reducing as far as it
seems to have wished all the overgrown prerogatives of the other
branches of the government this power over the purse may in
fact be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with
which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of
the people for obtaining a redress of every grievance and for
carrying into effect every just and salutary measure but will
not the house of representatives be as much interested as the
senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions and
will they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or
its reputation on the pliancy of the senate or if such a trial
of firmness between the two branches were hazarded would not the
one be as likely first to yield as the other these questions
will create no difficulty with those who reflect that in all
cases the smaller the number and the more permanent and
conspicuous the station of men in power the stronger must be
the interest which they will individually feel in whatever
concerns the government those who represent the dignity of their
country in the eyes of other nations will be particularly
sensible to every prospect of public danger or of dishonorable
stagnation in public affairs to those causes we are to ascribe
the continual triumph of the british house of commons over the
other branches of the government whenever the engine of a money
bill has been employed an absolute inflexibility on the side of
the latter although it could not have failed to involve every
department of the state in the general confusion has neither
been apprehended nor experienced the utmost degree of firmness
that can be displayed by the federal senate or president will
not be more than equal to a resistance in which they will be
supported by constitutional and patriotic principles in this
review of the constitution of the house of representatives i
have passed over the circumstances of economy which in the
present state of affairs might have had some effect in lessening
the temporary number of representatives and a disregard of which
would probably have been as rich a theme of declamation against
the constitution as has been shown by the smallness of the number
proposed i omit also any remarks on the difficulty which might
be found under present circumstances in engaging in the federal
service a large number of such characters as the people will
probably elect one observation however i must be permitted to
add on this subject as claiming in my judgment a very serious
attention it is that in all legislative assemblies the greater
the number composing them may be the fewer will be the men who
will in fact direct their proceedings in the first place the
more numerous an assembly may be of whatever characters
composed the greater is known to be the ascendency of passion
over reason in the next place the larger the number the
greater will be the proportion of members of limited information
and of weak capacities now it is precisely on characters of
this description that the eloquence and address of the few are
known to act with all their force in the ancient republics
where the whole body of the people assembled in person a single
orator or an artful statesman was generally seen to rule with
as complete a sway as if a sceptre had been placed in his single
hand on the same principle the more multitudinous a
representative assembly may be rendered the more it will partake
of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people
ignorance will be the dupe of cunning and passion the slave of
sophistry and declamation the people can never err more than in
supposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a
certain limit they strengthen the barrier against the government
of a few experience will forever admonish them that on the
contrary after securing a sufficient number for the purposes of
safety of local information and of diffusive sympathy with the
whole society they will counteract their own views by every
addition to their representatives the countenance of the
government may become more democratic but the soul that animates
it will be more oligarchic the machine will be enlarged but the
fewer and often the more secret will be the springs by which
its motions are directed as connected with the objection against
the number of representatives may properly be here noticed that
which has been suggested against the number made competent for
legislative business it has been said that more than a majority
ought to have been required for a quorum and in particular
cases if not in all more than a majority of a quorum for a
decision that some advantages might have resulted from such a
precaution cannot be denied it might have been an additional
shield to some particular interests and another obstacle
generally to hasty and partial measures but these considerations
are outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale in
all cases where justice or the general good might require new
laws to be passed or active measures to be pursued the
fundamental principle of free government would be reversed it
would be no longer the majority that would rule the power would
be transferred to the minority were the defensive privilege
limited to particular cases an interested minority might take
advantage of it to screen themselves from equitable sacrifices to
the general weal or in particular emergencies to extort
unreasonable indulgences lastly it would facilitate and foster
the baneful practice of secessions a practice which has shown
itself even in states where a majority only is required a
practice subversive of all the principles of order and regular
government a practice which leads more directly to public
convulsions and the ruin of popular governments than any other
which has yet been displayed among us publius 
federalist no 
concerning the power of congress to regulate the election of
members
from the new york packet friday february   
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the natural order of the subject leads us to consider in this
place that provision of the constitution which authorizes the
national legislature to regulate in the last resort the
election of its own members it is in these words the times
places and manner of holding elections for senators and
representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the
legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law
make or alter such regulations except as to the places of
choosing senators  this provision has not only been declaimed
against by those who condemn the constitution in the gross but
it has been censured by those who have objected with less
latitude and greater moderation and in one instance it has been
thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the
advocate of every other part of the system i am greatly
mistaken notwithstanding if there be any article in the whole
plan more completely defensible than this its propriety rests
upon the evidence of this plain proposition that every
government ought to contain in itself the means of its own
preservation every just reasoner will at first sight approve
an adherence to this rule in the work of the convention and
will disapprove every deviation from it which may not appear to
have been dictated by the necessity of incorporating into the
work some particular ingredient with which a rigid conformity to
the rule was incompatible even in this case though he may
acquiesce in the necessity yet he will not cease to regard and
to regret a departure from so fundamental a principle as a
portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of
future weakness and perhaps anarchy it will not be alleged
that an election law could have been framed and inserted in the
constitution which would have been always applicable to every
probable change in the situation of the country and it will
therefore not be denied that a discretionary power over
elections ought to exist somewhere it will i presume be as
readily conceded that there were only three ways in which this
power could have been reasonably modified and disposed that it
must either have been lodged wholly in the national legislature
or wholly in the state legislatures or primarily in the latter
and ultimately in the former the last mode has with reason
been preferred by the convention they have submitted the
regulation of elections for the federal government in the first
instance to the local administrations which in ordinary
cases and when no improper views prevail may be both more
convenient and more satisfactory but they have reserved to the
national authority a right to interpose whenever extraordinary
circumstances might render that interposition necessary to its
safety nothing can be more evident than that an exclusive
power of regulating elections for the national government in the
hands of the state legislatures would leave the existence of the
union entirely at their mercy they could at any moment
annihilate it by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons
to administer its affairs it is to little purpose to say that
a neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take
place the constitutional possibility of the thing without an
equivalent for the risk is an unanswerable objection nor has
any satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that
risk the extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can
never be dignified with that character if we are in a humor to
presume abuses of power it is as fair to presume them on the
part of the state governments as on the part of the general
government and as it is more consonant to the rules of a just
theory to trust the union with the care of its own existence
than to transfer that care to any other hands if abuses of power
are to be hazarded on the one side or on the other it is more
rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be
placed than where it would unnaturally be placed suppose an
article had been introduced into the constitution empowering the
united states to regulate the elections for the particular
states would any man have hesitated to condemn it both as an
unwarrantable transposition of power and as a premeditated
engine for the destruction of the state governments the
violation of principle in this case would have required no
comment and to an unbiased observer it will not be less
apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the
national government in a similar respect to the pleasure of the
state governments an impartial view of the matter cannot fail
to result in a conviction that each as far as possible ought
to depend on itself for its own preservation as an objection to
this position it may be remarked that the constitution of the
national senate would involve in its full extent the danger
which it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the
state legislatures to regulate the federal elections it may be
alleged that by declining the appointment of senators they
might at any time give a fatal blow to the union and from this
it may be inferred that as its existence would be thus rendered
dependent upon them in so essential a point there can be no
objection to intrusting them with it in the particular case under
consideration the interest of each state it may be added to
maintain its representation in the national councils would be a
complete security against an abuse of the trust this argument
though specious will not upon examination be found solid it
is certainly true that the state legislatures by forbearing the
appointment of senators may destroy the national government but
it will not follow that because they have a power to do this in
one instance they ought to have it in every other there are
cases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far
more decisive without any motive equally cogent with that which
must have regulated the conduct of the convention in respect to
the formation of the senate to recommend their admission into
the system so far as that construction may expose the union to
the possibility of injury from the state legislatures it is an
evil but it is an evil which could not have been avoided without
excluding the states in their political capacities wholly from
a place in the organization of the national government if this
had been done it would doubtless have been interpreted into an
entire dereliction of the federal principle and would certainly
have deprived the state governments of that absolute safeguard
which they will enjoy under this provision but however wise it
may have been to have submitted in this instance to an
inconvenience for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a
greater good no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an
accumulation of the evil where no necessity urges nor any
greater good invites it may be easily discerned also that the
national government would run a much greater risk from a power in
the state legislatures over the elections of its house of
representatives than from their power of appointing the members
of its senate the senators are to be chosen for the period of
six years there is to be a rotation by which the seats of a
third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two
years and no state is to be entitled to more than two senators
a quorum of the body is to consist of sixteen members the joint
result of these circumstances would be that a temporary
combination of a few states to intermit the appointment of
senators could neither annul the existence nor impair the
activity of the body and it is not from a general and permanent
combination of the states that we can have any thing to fear the
first might proceed from sinister designs in the leading members
of a few of the state legislatures the last would suppose a
fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the people
which will either never exist at all or will in all
probability proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the
general government to the advancement of their happiness in which
event no good citizen could desire its continuance but with
regard to the federal house of representatives there is intended
to be a general election of members once in two years if the
state legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of
regulating these elections every period of making them would be
a delicate crisis in the national situation which might issue in
a dissolution of the union if the leaders of a few of the most
important states should have entered into a previous conspiracy
to prevent an election i shall not deny that there is a degree
of weight in the observation that the interests of each state
to be represented in the federal councils will be a security
against the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of
the state legislatures but the security will not be considered
as complete by those who attend to the force of an obvious
distinction between the interest of the people in the public
felicity and the interest of their local rulers in the power and
consequence of their offices the people of america may be
warmly attached to the government of the union at times when the
particular rulers of particular states stimulated by the natural
rivalship of power and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement
and supported by a strong faction in each of those states may be
in a very opposite temper this diversity of sentiment between a
majority of the people and the individuals who have the
greatest credit in their councils is exemplified in some of the
states at the present moment on the present question the
scheme of separate confederacies which will always nultiply the
chances of ambition will be a never failing bait to all such
influential characters in the state administrations as are
capable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the
public weal with so effectual a weapon in their hands as the
exclusive power of regulating elections for the national
government a combination of a few such men in a few of the most
considerable states where the temptation will always be the
strongest might accomplish the destruction of the union by
seizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the
people and which perhaps they may themselves have excited to
discontinue the choice of members for the federal house of
representatives it ought never to be forgotten that a firm
union of this country under an efficient government will
probably be an increasing object of jealousy to more than one
nation of europe and that enterprises to subvert it will
sometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers and will
seldom fail to be patronized and abetted by some of them its
preservation therefore ought in no case that can be avoided to

concerning the power of congress to regulate the election of
 members
from the new york packet
tuesday february  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
we have seen that an uncontrollable power over the elections to
 the federal government could not without hazard be committed to
 the state legislatures let us now see what would be the danger on
 the other side that is from confiding the ultimate right of
 regulating its own elections to the union itself it is not
 pretended that this right would ever be used for the exclusion of
 any state from its share in the representation the interest of all
 would in this respect at least be the security of all but it is
 alleged that it might be employed in such a manner as to promote
 the election of some favorite class of men in exclusion of others
 by confining the places of election to particular districts and
 rendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in
 the choice of all chimerical suppositions this seems to be the
 most chimerical on the one hand no rational calculation of
 probabilities would lead us to imagine that the disposition which a
 conduct so violent and extraordinary would imply could ever find
 its way into the national councils and on the other it may be
 concluded with certainty that if so improper a spirit should ever
 gain admittance into them it would display itself in a form
 altogether different and far more decisive
the improbability of the attempt may be satisfactorily inferred
 from this single reflection that it could never be made without
 causing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people headed
 and directed by the state governments it is not difficult to
 conceive that this characteristic right of freedom may in certain
