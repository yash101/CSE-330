general introduction
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
after an unequivocal experience of the inefficiency of the
 subsisting federal government you are called upon to deliberate on
 a new constitution for the united states of america the subject
 speaks its own importance comprehending in its consequences
 nothing less than the existence of the union the safety and welfare
 of the parts of which it is composed the fate of an empire in many
 respects the most interesting in the world it has been frequently
 remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this
 country by their conduct and example to decide the important
 question whether societies of men are really capable or not of
 establishing good government from reflection and choice or whether
 they are forever destined to depend for their political
 constitutions on accident and force if there be any truth in the
 remark the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be
 regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made and a
 wrong election of the part we shall act may in this view deserve
 to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind
this idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of
 patriotism to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and
 good men must feel for the event happy will it be if our choice
 should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests
 unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the
 public good but this is a thing more ardently to be wished than
 seriously to be expected the plan offered to our deliberations
 affects too many particular interests innovates upon too many local
 institutions not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects
 foreign to its merits and of views passions and prejudices little
 favorable to the discovery of truth
among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new
 constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the
 obvious interest of a certain class of men in every state to resist
 all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power emolument
 and consequence of the offices they hold under the state
 establishments and the perverted ambition of another class of men
 who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of
 their country or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of
 elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial
 confederacies than from its union under one government
it is not however my design to dwell upon observations of this
 nature i am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve
 indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men merely because
 their situations might subject them to suspicion into interested or
 ambitious views candor will oblige us to admit that even such men
 may be actuated by upright intentions and it cannot be doubted
 that much of the opposition which has made its appearance or may
 hereafter make its appearance will spring from sources blameless
 at least if not respectablethe honest errors of minds led astray
 by preconceived jealousies and fears so numerous indeed and so
 powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the
 judgment that we upon many occasions see wise and good men on the
 wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first
 magnitude to society this circumstance if duly attended to would
 furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much
 persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy and a
 further reason for caution in this respect might be drawn from the
 reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the
 truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists
 ambition avarice personal animosity party opposition and many
 other motives not more laudable than these are apt to operate as
 well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a
 question were there not even these inducements to moderation
 nothing could be more illjudged than that intolerant spirit which
 has at all times characterized political parties for in
 politics as in religion it is equally absurd to aim at making
 proselytes by fire and sword heresies in either can rarely be
 cured by persecution
and yet however just these sentiments will be allowed to be we
 have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as
 in all former cases of great national discussion a torrent of
 angry and malignant passions will be let loose to judge from the
 conduct of the opposite parties we shall be led to conclude that
 they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions
 and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of
 their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives an
 enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be
 stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and
 hostile to the principles of liberty an overscrupulous jealousy
 of danger to the rights of the people which is more commonly the
 fault of the head than of the heart will be represented as mere
 pretense and artifice the stale bait for popularity at the expense
 of the public good it will be forgotten on the one hand that
 jealousy is the usual concomitant of love and that the noble
 enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow
 and illiberal distrust on the other hand it will be equally
 forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security
 of liberty that in the contemplation of a sound and wellinformed
 judgment their interest can never be separated and that a
 dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal
 for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of
 zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government history will
 teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to
 the introduction of despotism than the latter and that of those men
 who have overturned the liberties of republics the greatest number
 have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people
 commencing demagogues and ending tyrants
in the course of the preceding observations i have had an eye
 my fellowcitizens to putting you upon your guard against all
 attempts from whatever quarter to influence your decision in a
 matter of the utmost moment to your welfare by any impressions
 other than those which may result from the evidence of truth you
 will no doubt at the same time have collected from the general
 scope of them that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the
 new constitution yes my countrymen i own to you that after
 having given it an attentive consideration i am clearly of opinion
 it is your interest to adopt it i am convinced that this is the
 safest course for your liberty your dignity and your happiness i
 affect not reserves which i do not feel i will not amuse you with
 an appearance of deliberation when i have decided i frankly
 acknowledge to you my convictions and i will freely lay before you
 the reasons on which they are founded the consciousness of good
 intentions disdains ambiguity i shall not however multiply
 professions on this head my motives must remain in the depository
 of my own breast my arguments will be open to all and may be
 judged of by all they shall at least be offered in a spirit which
 will not disgrace the cause of truth
i propose in a series of papers to discuss the following
 interesting particulars 
the utility of the union to your political prosperity
the insufficiency of the present confederation
 to preserve that union  the necessity of a government at least
 equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this
 object  the conformity of the proposed constitution to the true
 principles of republican government 
 its analogy to your own state constitution 
 and lastly the additional security which its
 adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of
 government to liberty and to property
in the progress of this discussion i shall endeavor to give a
 satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made
 their appearance that may seem to have any claim to your attention
it may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to
 prove the utility of the union a point no doubt deeply engraved
 on the hearts of the great body of the people in every state and
 one which it may be imagined has no adversaries but the fact is
 that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those
 who oppose the new constitution that the thirteen states are of too
 great extent for any general system and that we must of necessity
 resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the
 whole this doctrine will in all probability be gradually
 propagated till it has votaries enough to countenance an open
 avowal of it for nothing can be more evident to those who are
 able to take an enlarged view of the subject than the alternative
 of an adoption of the new constitution or a dismemberment of the
 union it will therefore be of use to begin by examining the
 advantages of that union the certain evils and the probable
 dangers to which every state will be exposed from its dissolution
 this shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address
 publius
 the same idea tracing the arguments to their consequences is
 held out in several of the late publications against the new
 constitution
federalist no 
concerning dangers from foreign force and influence
for the independent journal
jay
to the people of the state of new york
when the people of america reflect that they are now called upon
 to decide a question which in its consequences must prove one of
 the most important that ever engaged their attention the propriety
 of their taking a very comprehensive as well as a very serious
 view of it will be evident
nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of
 government and it is equally undeniable that whenever and however
 it is instituted the people must cede to it some of their natural
 rights in order to vest it with requisite powers it is well worthy
 of consideration therefore whether it would conduce more to the
 interest of the people of america that they should to all general
 purposes be one nation under one federal government or that they
 should divide themselves into separate confederacies and give to
 the head of each the same kind of powers which they are advised to
 place in one national government
it has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion
 that the prosperity of the people of america depended on their
 continuing firmly united and the wishes prayers and efforts of
 our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that
 object but politicians now appear who insist that this opinion is
 erroneous and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in
 union we ought to seek it in a division of the states into distinct
 confederacies or sovereignties however extraordinary this new
 doctrine may appear it nevertheless has its advocates and certain
 characters who were much opposed to it formerly are at present of
 the number whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have
 wrought this change in the sentiments and declarations of these
 gentlemen it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to
 adopt these new political tenets without being fully convinced that
 they are founded in truth and sound policy
it has often given me pleasure to observe that independent
 america was not composed of detached and distant territories but
 that one connected fertile widespreading country was the portion
 of our western sons of liberty providence has in a particular
 manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions and
 watered it with innumerable streams for the delight and
 accommodation of its inhabitants a succession of navigable waters
 forms a kind of chain round its borders as if to bind it together
 while the most noble rivers in the world running at convenient
 distances present them with highways for the easy communication of
 friendly aids and the mutual transportation and exchange of their
 various commodities
with equal pleasure i have as often taken notice that providence
 has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united
 peoplea people descended from the same ancestors speaking the same
 language professing the same religion attached to the same
 principles of government very similar in their manners and customs
 and who by their joint counsels arms and efforts fighting side
 by side throughout a long and bloody war have nobly established
 general liberty and independence
this country and this people seem to have been made for each
 other and it appears as if it was the design of providence that an
 inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren united
 to each other by the strongest ties should never be split into a
 number of unsocial jealous and alien sovereignties
similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and
 denominations of men among us to all general purposes we have
 uniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere
 enjoying the same national rights privileges and protection as a
 nation we have made peace and war as a nation we have vanquished
 our common enemies as a nation we have formed alliances and made
 treaties and entered into various compacts and conventions with
 foreign states
a strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the
 people at a very early period to institute a federal government to
 preserve and perpetuate it they formed it almost as soon as they
 had a political existence nay at a time when their habitations
 were in flames when many of their citizens were bleeding and when
 the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those
 calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede
 the formation of a wise and wellbalanced government for a free
 people it is not to be wondered at that a government instituted
 in times so inauspicious should on experiment be found greatly
 deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer
this intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects
 still continuing no less attached to union than enamored of
 liberty they observed the danger which immediately threatened the
 former and more remotely the latter and being pursuaded that ample
 security for both could only be found in a national government more
 wisely framed they as with one voice convened the late convention
 at philadelphia to take that important subject under consideration
this convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of
 the people and many of whom had become highly distinguished by
 their patriotism virtue and wisdom in times which tried the minds
 and hearts of men undertook the arduous task in the mild season
 of peace with minds unoccupied by other subjects they passed many
 months in cool uninterrupted and daily consultation and finally
 without having been awed by power or influenced by any passions
 except love for their country they presented and recommended to the
 people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils
admit for so is the fact that this plan is only recommended
 not imposed yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended
 to blind approbation nor to blind reprobation but to that sedate
 and candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the
 subject demand and which it certainly ought to receive but this
 as was remarked in the foregoing number of this paper is more to
 be wished than expected that it may be so considered and examined
 experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine
 in such hopes it is not yet forgotten that wellgrounded
 apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of america to
 form the memorable congress of  that body recommended certain
 measures to their constituents and the event proved their wisdom
 yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem
 with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures not
 only many of the officers of government who obeyed the dictates of
 personal interest but others from a mistaken estimate of
 consequences or the undue influence of former attachments or whose
 ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public
 good were indefatigable in their efforts to pursuade the people to
 reject the advice of that patriotic congress many indeed were
 deceived and deluded but the great majority of the people reasoned
 and decided judiciously and happy they are in reflecting that they
 did so
they considered that the congress was composed of many wise and
 experienced men that being convened from different parts of the
 country they brought with them and communicated to each other a
 variety of useful information that in the course of the time they
 passed together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests
 of their country they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on
 that head that they were individually interested in the public
 liberty and prosperity and therefore that it was not less their
 inclination than their duty to recommend only such measures as
 after the most mature deliberation they really thought prudent and
 advisable
these and similar considerations then induced the people to rely
 greatly on the judgment and integrity of the congress and they
 took their advice notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors
 used to deter them from it but if the people at large had reason
 to confide in the men of that congress few of whom had been fully
 tried or generally known still greater reason have they now to
 respect the judgment and advice of the convention for it is well
 known that some of the most distinguished members of that congress
 who have been since tried and justly approved for patriotism and
 abilities and who have grown old in acquiring political
 information were also members of this convention and carried into
 it their accumulated knowledge and experience
it is worthy of remark that not only the first but every
 succeeding congress as well as the late convention have invariably
 joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of america
 depended on its union to preserve and perpetuate it was the great
 object of the people in forming that convention and it is also the
 great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to
 adopt with what propriety therefore or for what good purposes
 are attempts at this particular period made by some men to
 depreciate the importance of the union or why is it suggested that
 three or four confederacies would be better than one i am
 persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right
 on this subject and that their universal and uniform attachment to
 the cause of the union rests on great and weighty reasons which i
 shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers they
 who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct
 confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention seem
 clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the
 continuance of the union in the utmost jeopardy that certainly
 would be the case and i sincerely wish that it may be as clearly
 foreseen by every good citizen that whenever the dissolution of the
 union arrives america will have reason to exclaim in the words of
 the poet farewell a long farewell to all my greatness

the same subject continued
concerning dangers from foreign force and influence
for the independent journal
jay
to the people of the state of new york
it is not a new observation that the people of any country if
 like the americans intelligent and wellinformed seldom adopt and
 steadily persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting
 their interests that consideration naturally tends to create great
 respect for the high opinion which the people of america have so
 long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing
 firmly united under one federal government vested with sufficient
 powers for all general and national purposes
the more attentively i consider and investigate the reasons
 which appear to have given birth to this opinion the more i become
 convinced that they are cogent and conclusive
among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it
 necessary to direct their attention that of providing for their
 safety seems to be the first the safety of the people doubtless
 has relation to a great variety of circumstances and considerations
 and consequently affords great latitude to those who wish to define
 it precisely and comprehensively
at present i mean only to consider it as it respects security
 for the preservation of peace and tranquillity as well as against
 dangers from foreign arms and influence as from dangers of the like
 kind arising from domestic causes as the former of these comes
 first in order it is proper it should be the first discussed let
 us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in
 their opinion that a cordial union under an efficient national
 government affords them the best security that can be devised
 against hostilities from abroad
the number of wars which have happened or will happen in the
 world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and
 weight of the causes whether real or pretended which provoke or
 invite them if this remark be just it becomes useful to inquire
 whether so many just causes of war are likely to be given by united
 america as by disunited america for if it should turn out that
 united america will probably give the fewest then it will follow
 that in this respect the union tends most to preserve the people in
 a state of peace with other nations
the just causes of war for the most part arise either from
 violation of treaties or from direct violence america has already
 formed treaties with no less than six foreign nations and all of
 them except prussia are maritime and therefore able to annoy and
 injure us she has also extensive commerce with portugal spain
 and britain and with respect to the two latter has in addition
 the circumstance of neighborhood to attend to
it is of high importance to the peace of america that she
 observe the laws of nations towards all these powers and to me it
 appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done
 by one national government than it could be either by thirteen
 separate states or by three or four distinct confederacies
because when once an efficient national government is
 established the best men in the country will not only consent to
 serve but also will generally be appointed to manage it for
 although town or country or other contracted influence may place
 men in state assemblies or senates or courts of justice or
 executive departments yet more general and extensive reputation for
 talents and other qualifications will be necessary to recommend men
 to offices under the national governmentespecially as it will have
 the widest field for choice and never experience that want of
 proper persons which is not uncommon in some of the states hence
 it will result that the administration the political counsels and
 the judicial decisions of the national government will be more wise
 systematical and judicious than those of individual states and
 consequently more satisfactory with respect to other nations as
 well as more safe with respect to us
because under the national government treaties and articles of
 treaties as well as the laws of nations will always be expounded
 in one sense and executed in the same mannerwhereas adjudications
 on the same points and questions in thirteen states or in three or
 four confederacies will not always accord or be consistent and
 that as well from the variety of independent courts and judges
 appointed by different and independent governments as from the
 different local laws and interests which may affect and influence
 them the wisdom of the convention in committing such questions to
 the jurisdiction and judgment of courts appointed by and responsible
 only to one national government cannot be too much commended
because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often
 tempt the governing party in one or two states to swerve from good
 faith and justice but those temptations not reaching the other
 states and consequently having little or no influence on the
 national government the temptation will be fruitless and good
 faith and justice be preserved the case of the treaty of peace
 with britain adds great weight to this reasoning
because even if the governing party in a state should be
 disposed to resist such temptations yet as such temptations may
 and commonly do result from circumstances peculiar to the state
 and may affect a great number of the inhabitants the governing
 party may not always be able if willing to prevent the injustice
 meditated or to punish the aggressors but the national
 government not being affected by those local circumstances will
 neither be induced to commit the wrong themselves nor want power or
 inclination to prevent or punish its commission by others
so far therefore as either designed or accidental violations
 of treaties and the laws of nations afford just causes of war they
 are less to be apprehended under one general government than under
 several lesser ones and in that respect the former most favors the
 safety of the people
as to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and
 unlawful violence it appears equally clear to me that one good
 national government affords vastly more security against dangers of
 that sort than can be derived from any other quarter
because such violences are more frequently caused by the
 passions and interests of a part than of the whole of one or two
 states than of the union not a single indian war has yet been
 occasioned by aggressions of the present federal government feeble
 as it is but there are several instances of indian hostilities
 having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual states
 who either unable or unwilling to restrain or punish offenses have
 given occasion to the slaughter of many innocent inhabitants
the neighborhood of spanish and british territories bordering
 on some states and not on others naturally confines the causes of
 quarrel more immediately to the borderers the bordering states if
 any will be those who under the impulse of sudden irritation and
 a quick sense of apparent interest or injury will be most likely
 by direct violence to excite war with these nations and nothing
 can so effectually obviate that danger as a national government
 whose wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions
 which actuate the parties immediately interested
but not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the
 national government but it will also be more in their power to
 accommodate and settle them amicably they will be more temperate
 and cool and in that respect as well as in others will be more in
 capacity to act advisedly than the offending state the pride of
 states as well as of men naturally disposes them to justify all
 their actions and opposes their acknowledging correcting or
 repairing their errors and offenses the national government in
 such cases will not be affected by this pride but will proceed
 with moderation and candor to consider and decide on the means most
 proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them
besides it is well known that acknowledgments explanations
 and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong
 united nation which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered
 by a state or confederacy of little consideration or power
in the year  the state of genoa having offended louis xiv
 endeavored to appease him he demanded that they should send their
 doge or chief magistrate accompanied by four of their
 senators to france to ask his pardon and receive his terms they
 were obliged to submit to it for the sake of peace would he on any
 occasion either have demanded or have received the like humiliation
 from spain or britain or any other powerful nation

concerning dangers from foreign force and influence
for the independent journal
jay
to the people of the state of new york
my last paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the
 people would be best secured by union against the danger it may be
 exposed to by just causes of war given to other nations and those
 reasons show that such causes would not only be more rarely given
 but would also be more easily accommodated by a national government
 than either by the state governments or the proposed little
 confederacies
but the safety of the people of america against dangers from
 foreign force depends not only on their forbearing to give just
 causes of war to other nations but also on their placing and
 continuing themselves in such a situation as not to invite hostility
 or insult for it need not be observed that there are pretended as
 well as just causes of war
it is too true however disgraceful it may be to human nature
 that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect
 of getting anything by it nay absolute monarchs will often make
 war when their nations are to get nothing by it but for the
 purposes and objects merely personal such as thirst for military
 glory revenge for personal affronts ambition or private compacts
 to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans
 these and a variety of other motives which affect only the mind of
 the sovereign often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by
 justice or the voice and interests of his people but independent
 of these inducements to war which are more prevalent in absolute
 monarchies but which well deserve our attention there are others
 which affect nations as often as kings and some of them will on
 examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and
 circumstances
with france and with britain we are rivals in the fisheries and
 can supply their markets cheaper than they can themselves
 notwithstanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own
 or duties on foreign fish
with them and with most other european nations we are rivals in
 navigation and the carrying trade and we shall deceive ourselves
 if we suppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish
 for as our carrying trade cannot increase without in some degree
 diminishing theirs it is more their interest and will be more
 their policy to restrain than to promote it
in the trade to china and india we interfere with more than one
 nation inasmuch as it enables us to partake in advantages which
 they had in a manner monopolized and as we thereby supply ourselves
 with commodities which we used to purchase from them
the extension of our own commerce in our own vessels cannot give
 pleasure to any nations who possess territories on or near this
 continent because the cheapness and excellence of our productions
 added to the circumstance of vicinity and the enterprise and
 address of our merchants and navigators will give us a greater
 share in the advantages which those territories afford than
 consists with the wishes or policy of their respective sovereigns
spain thinks it convenient to shut the mississippi against us on
 the one side and britain excludes us from the saint lawrence on the
 other nor will either of them permit the other waters which are
 between them and us to become the means of mutual intercourse and
 traffic
from these and such like considerations which might if
 consistent with prudence be more amplified and detailed it is easy
 to see that jealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide into the
 minds and cabinets of other nations and that we are not to expect
 that they should regard our advancement in union in power and
 consequence by land and by sea with an eye of indifference and
 composure
the people of america are aware that inducements to war may
 arise out of these circumstances as well as from others not so
 obvious at present and that whenever such inducements may find fit
 time and opportunity for operation pretenses to color and justify
 them will not be wanting wisely therefore do they consider union
 and a good national government as necessary to put and keep them in
 such a situation as instead of inviting war will tend to repress
 and discourage it that situation consists in the best possible
 state of defense and necessarily depends on the government the
 arms and the resources of the country
as the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole and
 cannot be provided for without government either one or more or
 many let us inquire whether one good government is not relative to
 the object in question more competent than any other given number
 whatever
one government can collect and avail itself of the talents and
 experience of the ablest men in whatever part of the union they may
 be found it can move on uniform principles of policy it can
 harmonize assimilate and protect the several parts and members
 and extend the benefit of its foresight and precautions to each in
 the formation of treaties it will regard the interest of the whole
 and the particular interests of the parts as connected with that of
 the whole it can apply the resources and power of the whole to the
 defense of any particular part and that more easily and
 expeditiously than state governments or separate confederacies can
 possibly do for want of concert and unity of system it can place
 the militia under one plan of discipline and by putting their
 officers in a proper line of subordination to the chief magistrate
 will as it were consolidate them into one corps and thereby
 render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into
 three or four distinct independent companies
what would the militia of britain be if the english militia
 obeyed the government of england if the scotch militia obeyed the
 government of scotland and if the welsh militia obeyed the
 government of wales suppose an invasion would those three
 governments if they agreed at all be able with all their
 respective forces to operate against the enemy so effectually as
 the single government of great britain would
we have heard much of the fleets of britain and the time may
 come if we are wise when the fleets of america may engage
 attention but if one national government had not so regulated the
 navigation of britain as to make it a nursery for seamenif one
 national government had not called forth all the national means and
 materials for forming fleets their prowess and their thunder would
 never have been celebrated let england have its navigation and
 fleetlet scotland have its navigation and fleetlet wales have its
 navigation and fleetlet ireland have its navigation and fleetlet
 those four of the constituent parts of the british empire be be
 under four independent governments and it is easy to perceive how
 soon they would each dwindle into comparative insignificance
apply these facts to our own case leave america divided into
 thirteen or if you please into three or four independent
 governmentswhat armies could they raise and paywhat fleets could
 they ever hope to have if one was attacked would the others fly
 to its succor and spend their blood and money in its defense
 would there be no danger of their being flattered into neutrality
 by its specious promises or seduced by a too great fondness for
 peace to decline hazarding their tranquillity and present safety for
 the sake of neighbors of whom perhaps they have been jealous and
 whose importance they are content to see diminished although such
 conduct would not be wise it would nevertheless be natural the
 history of the states of greece and of other countries abounds
 with such instances and it is not improbable that what has so often
 happened would under similar circumstances happen again
but admit that they might be willing to help the invaded state
 or confederacy how and when and in what proportion shall aids of
 men and money be afforded who shall command the allied armies and
 from which of them shall he receive his orders who shall settle
 the terms of peace and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide
 between them and compel acquiescence various difficulties and
 inconveniences would be inseparable from such a situation whereas
 one government watching over the general and common interests and
 combining and directing the powers and resources of the whole would
 be free from all these embarrassments and conduce far more to the
 safety of the people
but whatever may be our situation whether firmly united under
 one national government or split into a number of confederacies
 certain it is that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as
 it is and they will act toward us accordingly if they see that
 our national government is efficient and well administered our
 trade prudently regulated our militia properly organized and
 disciplined our resources and finances discreetly managed our
 credit reestablished our people free contented and united they
 will be much more disposed to cultivate our friendship than provoke
 our resentment if on the other hand they find us either
 destitute of an effectual government each state doing right or
 wrong as to its rulers may seem convenient or split into three or
 four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies
 one inclining to britain another to france and a third to spain
 and perhaps played off against each other by the three what a poor
 pitiful figure will america make in their eyes how liable would
 she become not only to their contempt but to their outrage and how
 soon would dearbought experience proclaim that when a people or
 family so divide it never fails to be against themselves

to the people of the state of new york
queen anne in her letter of the st july  to the scotch
 parliament makes some observations on the importance of the union
 then forming between england and scotland which merit our attention 
 i shall present the public with one or two extracts from it an
 entire and perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting
 peace it will secure your religion liberty and property remove
 the animosities amongst yourselves and the jealousies and
 differences betwixt our two kingdoms it must increase your
 strength riches and trade and by this union the whole island
 being joined in affection and free from all apprehensions of
 different interest will be enabled to resist all its enemies
 we most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this
 great and weighty affair that the union may be brought to a happy
 conclusion being the only effectual way to secure our present and
 future happiness and disappoint the designs of our and your
 enemies who will doubtless on this occasion use their utmost
 endeavors to prevent or delay this union
it was remarked in the preceding paper that weakness and
 divisions at home would invite dangers from abroad and that
 nothing would tend more to secure us from them than union strength
 and good government within ourselves this subject is copious and
 cannot easily be exhausted
the history of great britain is the one with which we are in
 general the best acquainted and it gives us many useful lessons
 we may profit by their experience without paying the price which it
 cost them although it seems obvious to common sense that the
 people of such an island should be but one nation yet we find that
 they were for ages divided into three and that those three were
 almost constantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another
 notwithstanding their true interest with respect to the continental
 nations was really the same yet by the arts and policy and
 practices of those nations their mutual jealousies were perpetually
 kept inflamed and for a long series of years they were far more
 inconvenient and troublesome than they were useful and assisting to
 each other
should the people of america divide themselves into three or
 four nations would not the same thing happen would not similar
 jealousies arise and be in like manner cherished instead of their
 being joined in affection and free from all apprehension of
 different interests envy and jealousy would soon extinguish
 confidence and affection and the partial interests of each
 confederacy instead of the general interests of all america would
 be the only objects of their policy and pursuits hence like most
 other bordering nations they would always be either involved in
 disputes and war or live in the constant apprehension of them
the most sanguine advocates for three or four confederacies
 cannot reasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an
 equal footing in point of strength even if it was possible to form
 them so at first but admitting that to be practicable yet what
 human contrivance can secure the continuance of such equality
 independent of those local circumstances which tend to beget and
 increase power in one part and to impede its progress in another we
 must advert to the effects of that superior policy and good
 management which would probably distinguish the government of one
 above the rest and by which their relative equality in strength and
 consideration would be destroyed for it cannot be presumed that
 the same degree of sound policy prudence and foresight would
 uniformly be observed by each of these confederacies for a long
 succession of years
whenever and from whatever causes it might happen and happen
 it would that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise
 on the scale of political importance much above the degree of her
 neighbors that moment would those neighbors behold her with envy
 and with fear both those passions would lead them to countenance
 if not to promote whatever might promise to diminish her
 importance and would also restrain them from measures calculated
 to advance or even to secure her prosperity much time would not be
 necessary to enable her to discern these unfriendly dispositions
 she would soon begin not only to lose confidence in her neighbors
 but also to feel a disposition equally unfavorable to them
 distrust naturally creates distrust and by nothing is goodwill
 and kind conduct more speedily changed than by invidious jealousies
 and uncandid imputations whether expressed or implied
the north is generally the region of strength and many local
 circumstances render it probable that the most northern of the
 proposed confederacies would at a period not very distant be
 unquestionably more formidable than any of the others no sooner
 would this become evident than the northern hive would excite the
 same ideas and sensations in the more southern parts of america
 which it formerly did in the southern parts of europe nor does it
 appear to be a rash conjecture that its young swarms might often be
 tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and milder air
 of their luxurious and more delicate neighbors
they who well consider the history of similar divisions and
 confederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in
 contemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they
 would be borderers that they would neither love nor trust one
 another but on the contrary would be a prey to discord jealousy
 and mutual injuries in short that they would place us exactly in
 the situations in which some nations doubtless wish to see us viz
 formidable only to each other
from these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are
 greatly mistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive
 might be formed between these confederacies and would produce that
 combination and union of wills of arms and of resources which would
 be necessary to put and keep them in a formidable state of defense
 against foreign enemies
when did the independent states into which britain and spain
 were formerly divided combine in such alliance or unite their
 forces against a foreign enemy the proposed confederacies will be
 distinct nations each of them would have its commerce with
 foreigners to regulate by distinct treaties and as their
 productions and commodities are different and proper for different
 markets so would those treaties be essentially different
 different commercial concerns must create different interests and
 of course different degrees of political attachment to and
 connection with different foreign nations hence it might and
 probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the southern
 confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the northern
 confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and
 friendship an alliance so contrary to their immediate interest
 would not therefore be easy to form nor if formed would it be
 observed and fulfilled with perfect good faith
nay it is far more probable that in america as in europe
 neighboring nations acting under the impulse of opposite interests
 and unfriendly passions would frequently be found taking different
 sides considering our distance from europe it would be more
 natural for these confederacies to apprehend danger from one another
 than from distant nations and therefore that each of them should be
 more desirous to guard against the others by the aid of foreign
 alliances than to guard against foreign dangers by alliances
 between themselves and here let us not forget how much more easy
 it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports and foreign armies
 into our country than it is to persuade or compel them to depart
 how many conquests did the romans and others make in the characters
 of allies and what innovations did they under the same character
 introduce into the governments of those whom they pretended to
 protect
let candid men judge then whether the division of america into
 any given number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure
 us against the hostilities and improper interference of foreign
 nations

concerning dangers from dissensions between the states
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an
 enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed in a state
 of disunion from the arms and arts of foreign nations i shall now
 proceed to delineate dangers of a different and perhaps still more
 alarming kindthose which will in all probability flow from
 dissensions between the states themselves and from domestic
 factions and convulsions these have been already in some instances
 slightly anticipated but they deserve a more particular and more
 full investigation
a man must be far gone in utopian speculations who can seriously
 doubt that if these states should either be wholly disunited or
 only united in partial confederacies the subdivisions into which
 they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with
 each other to presume a want of motives for such contests as an
 argument against their existence would be to forget that men are
 ambitious vindictive and rapacious to look for a continuation of
 harmony between a number of independent unconnected sovereignties
 in the same neighborhood would be to disregard the uniform course
 of human events and to set at defiance the accumulated experience
 of ages
the causes of hostility among nations are innumerable there
 are some which have a general and almost constant operation upon the
 collective bodies of society of this description are the love of
 power or the desire of preeminence and dominionthe jealousy of
 power or the desire of equality and safety there are others which
 have a more circumscribed though an equally operative influence
 within their spheres such are the rivalships and competitions of
 commerce between commercial nations and there are others not less
 numerous than either of the former which take their origin entirely
 in private passions in the attachments enmities interests
 hopes and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which
 they are members men of this class whether the favorites of a
 king or of a people have in too many instances abused the
 confidence they possessed and assuming the pretext of some public
 motive have not scrupled to sacrifice the national tranquillity to
 personal advantage or personal gratification
the celebrated pericles in compliance with the resentment of a
 prostitute at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of
 his countrymen attacked vanquished and destroyed the city of the
 samnians the same man stimulated by private pique against the
 megarensians another nation of greece or to avoid a
 prosecution with which he was threatened as an accomplice of a
 supposed theft of the statuary phidias or to get rid of the
 accusations prepared to be brought against him for dissipating the
 funds of the state in the purchase of popularity or from a
 combination of all these causes was the primitive author of that
 famous and fatal war distinguished in the grecian annals by the
 name of the peloponnesian war which after various vicissitudes
 intermissions and renewals terminated in the ruin of the athenian
 commonwealth
the ambitious cardinal who was prime minister to henry viii
 permitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown
 entertained hopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid
 prize by the influence of the emperor charles v to secure the
 favor and interest of this enterprising and powerful monarch he
 precipitated england into a war with france contrary to the
 plainest dictates of policy and at the hazard of the safety and
 independence as well of the kingdom over which he presided by his
 counsels as of europe in general for if there ever was a
 sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal monarchy
 it was the emperor charles v of whose intrigues wolsey was at once
 the instrument and the dupe
the influence which the bigotry of one female the
 petulance of another and the cabals of a third had in
 the contemporary policy ferments and pacifications of a
 considerable part of europe are topics that have been too often
 descanted upon not to be generally known
to multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in
 the production of great national events either foreign or domestic
 according to their direction would be an unnecessary waste of time
 those who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from
 which they are to be drawn will themselves recollect a variety of
 instances and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature
 will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either
 of the reality or extent of that agency perhaps however a
 reference tending to illustrate the general principle may with
 propriety be made to a case which has lately happened among
 ourselves if shays had not been a desperate debtor it is much to
 be doubted whether massachusetts would have been plunged into a
 civil war
but notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience in
 this particular there are still to be found visionary or designing
 men who stand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace
 between the states though dismembered and alienated from each other 
 the genius of republics say they is pacific the spirit of
 commerce has a tendency to soften the manners of men and to
 extinguish those inflammable humors which have so often kindled into
 wars commercial republics like ours will never be disposed to
 waste themselves in ruinous contentions with each other they will
 be governed by mutual interest and will cultivate a spirit of
 mutual amity and concord
is it not we may ask these projectors in politics the true
 interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and
 philosophic spirit if this be their true interest have they in
 fact pursued it has it not on the contrary invariably been found
 that momentary passions and immediate interest have a more active
 and imperious control over human conduct than general or remote
 considerations of policy utility or justice have republics in
 practice been less addicted to war than monarchies are not the
 former administered by men as well as the latter are there not
 aversions predilections rivalships and desires of unjust
 acquisitions that affect nations as well as kings are not popular
 assemblies frequently subject to the impulses of rage resentment
 jealousy avarice and of other irregular and violent propensities
 is it not well known that their determinations are often governed
 by a few individuals in whom they place confidence and are of
 course liable to be tinctured by the passions and views of those
 individuals has commerce hitherto done anything more than change
 the objects of war is not the love of wealth as domineering and
 enterprising a passion as that of power or glory have there not
 been as many wars founded upon commercial motives since that has
 become the prevailing system of nations as were before occasioned
 by the cupidity of territory or dominion has not the spirit of
 commerce in many instances administered new incentives to the
 appetite both for the one and for the other let experience the
 least fallible guide of human opinions be appealed to for an answer
 to these inquiries
sparta athens rome and carthage were all republics two of
 them athens and carthage of the commercial kind yet were they as
 often engaged in wars offensive and defensive as the neighboring
 monarchies of the same times sparta was little better than a
 wellregulated camp and rome was never sated of carnage and
 conquest
carthage though a commercial republic was the aggressor in the
 very war that ended in her destruction hannibal had carried her
 arms into the heart of italy and to the gates of rome before
 scipio in turn gave him an overthrow in the territories of
 carthage and made a conquest of the commonwealth
venice in later times figured more than once in wars of
 ambition till becoming an object to the other italian states pope
 julius ii found means to accomplish that formidable league
 which gave a deadly blow to the power and pride of this haughty
 republic
the provinces of holland till they were overwhelmed in debts
 and taxes took a leading and conspicuous part in the wars of europe 
 they had furious contests with england for the dominion of the
 sea and were among the most persevering and most implacable of the
 opponents of louis xiv
in the government of britain the representatives of the people
 compose one branch of the national legislature commerce has been
 for ages the predominant pursuit of that country few nations
 nevertheless have been more frequently engaged in war and the
 wars in which that kingdom has been engaged have in numerous
 instances proceeded from the people
there have been if i may so express it almost as many popular
 as royal wars the cries of the nation and the importunities of
 their representatives have upon various occasions dragged their
 monarchs into war or continued them in it contrary to their
 inclinations and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the
 state in that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival
 houses of austria and bourbon which so long kept europe in a flame
 it is well known that the antipathies of the english against the
 french seconding the ambition or rather the avarice of a favorite
 leader protracted the war beyond the limits marked out by
 sound policy and for a considerable time in opposition to the views
 of the court
the wars of these two lastmentioned nations have in a great
 measure grown out of commercial considerationsthe desire of
 supplanting and the fear of being supplanted either in particular
 branches of traffic or in the general advantages of trade and
 navigation
from this summary of what has taken place in other countries
 whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own what
 reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce
 us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members
 of the present confederacy in a state of separation have we not
 already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle
 theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the
 imperfections weaknesses and evils incident to society in every
 shape is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden
 age and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our
 political conduct that we as well as the other inhabitants of the
 globe are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and
 perfect virtue
let the point of extreme depression to which our national
 dignity and credit have sunk let the inconveniences felt everywhere
 from a lax and ill administration of government let the revolt of a
 part of the state of north carolina the late menacing disturbances
 in pennsylvania and the actual insurrections and rebellions in
 massachusetts declare
so far is the general sense of mankind from corresponding with
 the tenets of those who endeavor to lull asleep our apprehensions of
 discord and hostility between the states in the event of disunion
 that it has from long observation of the progress of society become
 a sort of axiom in politics that vicinity or nearness of situation
 constitutes nations natural enemies an intelligent writer
 expresses himself on this subject to this effect neighboring
 nations says he are naturally enemies of each other unless their
 common weakness forces them to league in a confederate republic and
 their constitution prevents the differences that neighborhood
 occasions extinguishing that secret jealousy which disposes all
 states to aggrandize themselves at the expense of their
 neighbors this passage at the same time points out the

to the people of the state of new york
it is sometimes asked with an air of seeming triumph what
 inducements could the states have if disunited to make war upon
 each other it would be a full answer to this question to
 sayprecisely the same inducements which have at different times
 deluged in blood all the nations in the world but unfortunately
 for us the question admits of a more particular answer there are
 causes of differences within our immediate contemplation of the
 tendency of which even under the restraints of a federal
 constitution we have had sufficient experience to enable us to form
 a judgment of what might be expected if those restraints were
 removed
territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the
 most fertile sources of hostility among nations perhaps the
 greatest proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have
 sprung from this origin this cause would exist among us in full
 force we have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the
 boundaries of the united states there still are discordant and
 undecided claims between several of them and the dissolution of the
 union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them all
 it is well known that they have heretofore had serious and animated
 discussion concerning the rights to the lands which were ungranted
 at the time of the revolution and which usually went under the name
 of crown lands the states within the limits of whose colonial
 governments they were comprised have claimed them as their property
 the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this
 article devolved upon the union especially as to all that part of
 the western territory which either by actual possession or through
 the submission of the indian proprietors was subjected to the
 jurisdiction of the king of great britain till it was relinquished
 in the treaty of peace this it has been said was at all events
 an acquisition to the confederacy by compact with a foreign power
 it has been the prudent policy of congress to appease this
 controversy by prevailing upon the states to make cessions to the
 united states for the benefit of the whole this has been so far
 accomplished as under a continuation of the union to afford a
 decided prospect of an amicable termination of the dispute a
 dismemberment of the confederacy however would revive this
 dispute and would create others on the same subject at present a
 large part of the vacant western territory is by cession at least
 if not by any anterior right the common property of the union if
 that were at an end the states which made the cession on a
 principle of federal compromise would be apt when the motive of the
 grant had ceased to reclaim the lands as a reversion the other
 states would no doubt insist on a proportion by right of
 representation their argument would be that a grant once made
 could not be revoked and that the justice of participating in
 territory acquired or secured by the joint efforts of the
 confederacy remained undiminished if contrary to probability it
 should be admitted by all the states that each had a right to a
 share of this common stock there would still be a difficulty to be
 surmounted as to a proper rule of apportionment different
 principles would be set up by different states for this purpose
 and as they would affect the opposite interests of the parties
 they might not easily be susceptible of a pacific adjustment
in the wide field of western territory therefore we perceive
 an ample theatre for hostile pretensions without any umpire or
 common judge to interpose between the contending parties to reason
 from the past to the future we shall have good ground to apprehend
 that the sword would sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of
 their differences the circumstances of the dispute between
 connecticut and pennsylvania respecting the land at wyoming
 admonish us not to be sanguine in expecting an easy accommodation of
 such differences the articles of confederation obliged the parties
 to submit the matter to the decision of a federal court the
 submission was made and the court decided in favor of pennsylvania
 but connecticut gave strong indications of dissatisfaction with
 that determination nor did she appear to be entirely resigned to
 it till by negotiation and management something like an
 equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have
 sustained nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest
 censure on the conduct of that state she no doubt sincerely
 believed herself to have been injured by the decision and states
 like individuals acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations
 to their disadvantage
those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the
 transactions which attended the progress of the controversy between
 this state and the district of vermont can vouch the opposition we
 experienced as well from states not interested as from those which
 were interested in the claim and can attest the danger to which
 the peace of the confederacy might have been exposed had this state
 attempted to assert its rights by force two motives preponderated
 in that opposition one a jealousy entertained of our future
 power and the other the interest of certain individuals of
 influence in the neighboring states who had obtained grants of
 lands under the actual government of that district even the states
 which brought forward claims in contradiction to ours seemed more
 solicitous to dismember this state than to establish their own
 pretensions these were new hampshire massachusetts and
 connecticut new jersey and rhode island upon all occasions
 discovered a warm zeal for the independence of vermont and
 maryland till alarmed by the appearance of a connection between
 canada and that state entered deeply into the same views these
 being small states saw with an unfriendly eye the perspective of
 our growing greatness in a review of these transactions we may
 trace some of the causes which would be likely to embroil the states
 with each other if it should be their unpropitious destiny to
 become disunited
the competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of
 contention the states less favorably circumstanced would be
 desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local situation and
 of sharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors
 each state or separate confederacy would pursue a system of
 commercial policy peculiar to itself this would occasion
 distinctions preferences and exclusions which would beget
 discontent the habits of intercourse on the basis of equal
 privileges to which we have been accustomed since the earliest
 settlement of the country would give a keener edge to those causes
 of discontent than they would naturally have independent of this
 circumstance we should be ready to denominate injuries those
 things which were in reality the justifiable acts of independent
 sovereignties consulting a distinct interest the spirit of
 enterprise which characterizes the commercial part of america has
 left no occasion of displaying itself unimproved it is not at all
 probable that this unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those
 regulations of trade by which particular states might endeavor to
 secure exclusive benefits to their own citizens the infractions of
 these regulations on one side the efforts to prevent and repel
 them on the other would naturally lead to outrages and these to
 reprisals and wars
the opportunities which some states would have of rendering
 others tributary to them by commercial regulations would be
 impatiently submitted to by the tributary states the relative
 situation of new york connecticut and new jersey would afford an
 example of this kind new york from the necessities of revenue
 must lay duties on her importations a great part of these duties
 must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other states in the
 capacity of consumers of what we import new york would neither be
 willing nor able to forego this advantage her citizens would not
 consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of the
 citizens of her neighbors nor would it be practicable if there
 were not this impediment in the way to distinguish the customers in
 our own markets would connecticut and new jersey long submit to be
 taxed by new york for her exclusive benefit should we be long
 permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of a
 metropolis from the possession of which we derived an advantage so
 odious to our neighbors and in their opinion so oppressive
 should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent weight of
 connecticut on the one side and the cooperating pressure of new
 jersey on the other these are questions that temerity alone will
 answer in the affirmative
the public debt of the union would be a further cause of
 collision between the separate states or confederacies the
 apportionment in the first instance and the progressive
 extinguishment afterward would be alike productive of illhumor and
 animosity how would it be possible to agree upon a rule of
 apportionment satisfactory to all there is scarcely any that can
 be proposed which is entirely free from real objections these as
 usual would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the parties
 there are even dissimilar views among the states as to the general
 principle of discharging the public debt some of them either less
 impressed with the importance of national credit or because their
 citizens have little if any immediate interest in the question
 feel an indifference if not a repugnance to the payment of the
 domestic debt at any rate these would be inclined to magnify the
 difficulties of a distribution others of them a numerous body of
 whose citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the
 state in the total amount of the national debt would be strenuous
 for some equitable and effective provision the procrastinations of
 the former would excite the resentments of the latter the
 settlement of a rule would in the meantime be postponed by real
 differences of opinion and affected delays the citizens of the
 states interested would clamour foreign powers would urge for the
 satisfaction of their just demands and the peace of the states
 would be hazarded to the double contingency of external invasion and
 internal contention
suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted and
 the apportionment made still there is great room to suppose that
 the rule agreed upon would upon experiment be found to bear harder
 upon some states than upon others those which were sufferers by it
 would naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden the others
 would as naturally be disinclined to a revision which was likely to
 end in an increase of their own incumbrances their refusal would
 be too plausible a pretext to the complaining states to withhold
 their contributions not to be embraced with avidity and the
 noncompliance of these states with their engagements would be a
 ground of bitter discussion and altercation if even the rule
 adopted should in practice justify the equality of its principle
 still delinquencies in payments on the part of some of the states
 would result from a diversity of other causesthe real deficiency of
 resources the mismanagement of their finances accidental
 disorders in the management of the government and in addition to
 the rest the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for
 purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced them and
 interfere with the supply of immediate wants delinquencies from
 whatever causes would be productive of complaints recriminations
 and quarrels there is perhaps nothing more likely to disturb the
 tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual
 contributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and
 coincident benefit for it is an observation as true as it is
 trite that there is nothing men differ so readily about as the
 payment of money
laws in violation of private contracts as they amount to
 aggressions on the rights of those states whose citizens are injured
 by them may be considered as another probable source of hostility
 we are not authorized to expect that a more liberal or more
 equitable spirit would preside over the legislations of the
 individual states hereafter if unrestrained by any additional
 checks than we have heretofore seen in too many instances
 disgracing their several codes we have observed the disposition to
 retaliation excited in connecticut in consequence of the enormities
 perpetrated by the legislature of rhode island and we reasonably
 infer that in similar cases under other circumstances a war not
 of parchment but of the sword would chastise such atrocious
 breaches of moral obligation and social justice
the probability of incompatible alliances between the different
 states or confederacies and different foreign nations and the
 effects of this situation upon the peace of the whole have been
 sufficiently unfolded in some preceding papers from the view they
 have exhibited of this part of the subject this conclusion is to be
 drawn that america if not connected at all or only by the feeble
 tie of a simple league offensive and defensive would by the
 operation of such jarring alliances be gradually entangled in all
 the pernicious labyrinths of european politics and wars and by the
 destructive contentions of the parts into which she was divided
 would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations
 of powers equally the enemies of them all divide et
 impera must be the motto of every nation that either hates or
 fears us publius

assuming it therefore as an established truth that the several
 states in case of disunion or such combinations of them as might
 happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general confederacy
 would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war of
 friendship and enmity with each other which have fallen to the lot
 of all neighboring nations not united under one government let us
 enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would
 attend such a situation
war between the states in the first period of their separate
 existence would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it
 commonly is in those countries where regular military establishments
 have long obtained the disciplined armies always kept on foot on
 the continent of europe though they bear a malignant aspect to
 liberty and economy have notwithstanding been productive of the
 signal advantage of rendering sudden conquests impracticable and of
 preventing that rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of
 war prior to their introduction the art of fortification has
 contributed to the same ends the nations of europe are encircled
 with chains of fortified places which mutually obstruct invasion
 campaigns are wasted in reducing two or three frontier garrisons
 to gain admittance into an enemys country similar impediments
 occur at every step to exhaust the strength and delay the progress
 of an invader formerly an invading army would penetrate into the
 heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as intelligence of its
 approach could be received but now a comparatively small force of
 disciplined troops acting on the defensive with the aid of posts
 is able to impede and finally to frustrate the enterprises of one
 much more considerable the history of war in that quarter of the
 globe is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires
 overturned but of towns taken and retaken of battles that decide
 nothing of retreats more beneficial than victories of much
 effort and little acquisition
in this country the scene would be altogether reversed the
 jealousy of military establishments would postpone them as long as
 possible the want of fortifications leaving the frontiers of one
 state open to another would facilitate inroads the populous
 states would with little difficulty overrun their less populous
 neighbors conquests would be as easy to be made as difficult to be
 retained war therefore would be desultory and predatory
 plunder and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars the
 calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the
 events which would characterize our military exploits
this picture is not too highly wrought though i confess it
 would not long remain a just one safety from external danger is
 the most powerful director of national conduct even the ardent
 love of liberty will after a time give way to its dictates the
 violent destruction of life and property incident to war the
 continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger
 will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for
 repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy
 their civil and political rights to be more safe they at length
 become willing to run the risk of being less free
the institutions chiefly alluded to are standing armies and the
 correspondent appendages of military establishments standing
 armies it is said are not provided against in the new
 constitution and it is therefore inferred that they may exist
 under it their existence however from the very terms of the
 proposition is at most problematical and uncertain but standing
 armies it may be replied must inevitably result from a dissolution
 of the confederacy frequent war and constant apprehension which
 require a state of as constant preparation will infallibly produce
 them the weaker states or confederacies would first have recourse
 to them to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent
 neighbors they would endeavor to supply the inferiority of
 population and resources by a more regular and effective system of
 defense by disciplined troops and by fortifications they would
 at the same time be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of
 government in doing which their constitutions would acquire a
 progressive direction toward monarchy it is of the nature of war
 to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative
 authority
the expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the
 states or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over
 their neighbors small states or states of less natural strength
 under vigorous governments and with the assistance of disciplined
 armies have often triumphed over large states or states of greater
 natural strength which have been destitute of these advantages
 neither the pride nor the safety of the more important states or
 confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying
 and adventitious superiority they would quickly resort to means
 similar to those by which it had been effected to reinstate
 themselves in their lost preeminence thus we should in a little
 time see established in every part of this country the same engines
 of despotism which have been the scourge of the old world this at
 least would be the natural course of things and our reasonings
 will be the more likely to be just in proportion as they are
 accommodated to this standard
these are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or
 speculative defects in a constitution the whole power of which is
 lodged in the hands of a people or their representatives and
 delegates but they are solid conclusions drawn from the natural
 and necessary progress of human affairs
it may perhaps be asked by way of objection to this why did
 not standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often
 distracted the ancient republics of greece different answers
 equally satisfactory may be given to this question the
 industrious habits of the people of the present day absorbed in the
 pursuits of gain and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and
 commerce are incompatible with the condition of a nation of
 soldiers which was the true condition of the people of those
 republics the means of revenue which have been so greatly
 multiplied by the increase of gold and silver and of the arts of
 industry and the science of finance which is the offspring of
 modern times concurring with the habits of nations have produced
 an entire revolution in the system of war and have rendered
 disciplined armies distinct from the body of the citizens the
 inseparable companions of frequent hostility
there is a wide difference also between military
 establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to
 internal invasions and in one which is often subject to them and
 always apprehensive of them the rulers of the former can have a
 good pretext if they are even so inclined to keep on foot armies
 so numerous as must of necessity be maintained in the latter these
 armies being in the first case rarely if at all called into
 activity for interior defense the people are in no danger of being
 broken to military subordination the laws are not accustomed to
 relaxations in favor of military exigencies the civil state
 remains in full vigor neither corrupted nor confounded with the
 principles or propensities of the other state the smallness of the
 army renders the natural strength of the community an overmatch for
 it and the citizens not habituated to look up to the military
 power for protection or to submit to its oppressions neither love
 nor fear the soldiery they view them with a spirit of jealous
 acquiescence in a necessary evil and stand ready to resist a power
 which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights
 the army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate
 to suppress a small faction or an occasional mob or insurrection
 but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united
 efforts of the great body of the people
in a country in the predicament last described the contrary of
 all this happens the perpetual menacings of danger oblige the
 government to be always prepared to repel it its armies must be
 numerous enough for instant defense the continual necessity for
 their services enhances the importance of the soldier and
 proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen the military
 state becomes elevated above the civil the inhabitants of
 territories often the theatre of war are unavoidably subjected to
 frequent infringements on their rights which serve to weaken their
 sense of those rights and by degrees the people are brought to
 consider the soldiery not only as their protectors but as their
 superiors the transition from this disposition to that of
 considering them masters is neither remote nor difficult but it
 is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions
 to make a bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by
 the military power
the kingdom of great britain falls within the first description
 an insular situation and a powerful marine guarding it in a great
 measure against the possibility of foreign invasion supersede the
 necessity of a numerous army within the kingdom a sufficient force
 to make head against a sudden descent till the militia could have
 time to rally and embody is all that has been deemed requisite no
 motive of national policy has demanded nor would public opinion
 have tolerated a larger number of troops upon its domestic
 establishment there has been for a long time past little room
 for the operation of the other causes which have been enumerated as
 the consequences of internal war this peculiar felicity of
 situation has in a great degree contributed to preserve the
 liberty which that country to this day enjoys in spite of the
 prevalent venality and corruption if on the contrary britain had
 been situated on the continent and had been compelled as she would
 have been by that situation to make her military establishments at
 home coextensive with those of the other great powers of europe
 she like them would in all probability be at this day a victim
 to the absolute power of a single man t is possible though not
 easy that the people of that island may be enslaved from other
 causes but it cannot be by the prowess of an army so
 inconsiderable as that which has been usually kept up within the
 kingdom
if we are wise enough to preserve the union we may for ages
 enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation
 europe is at a great distance from us her colonies in our
 vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in
 strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance extensive
 military establishments cannot in this position be necessary to
 our security but if we should be disunited and the integral parts
 should either remain separated or which is most probable should
 be thrown together into two or three confederacies we should be in
 a short course of time in the predicament of the continental powers
 of europe our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending
 ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other
this is an idea not superficial or futile but solid and weighty 
 it deserves the most serious and mature consideration of every
 prudent and honest man of whatever party if such men will make a
 firm and solemn pause and meditate dispassionately on the
 importance of this interesting idea if they will contemplate it in
 all its attitudes and trace it to all its consequences they will
 not hesitate to part with trivial objections to a constitution the
 rejection of which would in all probability put a final period to
 the union the airy phantoms that flit before the distempered
 imaginations of some of its adversaries would quickly give place to
 the more substantial forms of dangers real certain and formidable
publius
 this objection will be fully examined in its proper place and
 it will be shown that the only natural precaution which could have
 been taken on this subject has been taken and a much better one
 than is to be found in any constitution that has been heretofore
 framed in america most of which contain no guard at all on this
 subject

for the independent journal

to the people of the state of new york
a firm union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and
 liberty of the states as a barrier against domestic faction and
 insurrection it is impossible to read the history of the petty
 republics of greece and italy without feeling sensations of horror
 and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually
 agitated and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they
 were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of
 tyranny and anarchy if they exhibit occasional calms these only
 serve as shortlived contrast to the furious storms that are to
 succeed if now and then intervals of felicity open to view we
 behold them with a mixture of regret arising from the reflection
 that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the
 tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage if momentary rays of
 glory break forth from the gloom while they dazzle us with a
 transient and fleeting brilliancy they at the same time admonish us
 to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction
 and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted
 endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been
 so justly celebrated
from the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics
 the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments not only against
 the forms of republican government but against the very principles
 of civil liberty they have decried all free government as
 inconsistent with the order of society and have indulged themselves
 in malicious exultation over its friends and partisans happily for
 mankind stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty which
 have flourished for ages have in a few glorious instances refuted
 their gloomy sophisms and i trust america will be the broad and
 solid foundation of other edifices not less magnificent which will
 be equally permanent monuments of their errors
but it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched
 of republican government were too just copies of the originals from
 which they were taken if it had been found impracticable to have
 devised models of a more perfect structure the enlightened friends
 to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that
 species of government as indefensible the science of politics
 however like most other sciences has received great improvement
 the efficacy of various principles is now well understood which
 were either not known at all or imperfectly known to the ancients
 the regular distribution of power into distinct departments the
 introduction of legislative balances and checks the institution of
 courts composed of judges holding their offices during good
 behavior the representation of the people in the legislature by
 deputies of their own election these are wholly new discoveries
 or have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern
 times they are means and powerful means by which the excellences
 of republican government may be retained and its imperfections
 lessened or avoided to this catalogue of circumstances that tend
 to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government i shall
 venture however novel it may appear to some to add one more on a
 principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the
 new constitution i mean the enlargement of the orbit within which
 such systems are to revolve either in respect to the dimensions of
 a single state or to the consolidation of several smaller states
 into one great confederacy the latter is that which immediately
 concerns the object under consideration it will however be of
 use to examine the principle in its application to a single state
 which shall be attended to in another place
the utility of a confederacy as well to suppress faction and to
 guard the internal tranquillity of states as to increase their
 external force and security is in reality not a new idea it has
 been practiced upon in different countries and ages and has
 received the sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of
 politics the opponents of the plan proposed have with great
 assiduity cited and circulated the observations of montesquieu on
 the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government
 but they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that
 great man expressed in another part of his work nor to have
 adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they
 subscribe with such ready acquiescence
when montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics the
 standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits
 of almost every one of these states neither virginia
 massachusetts pennsylvania new york north carolina nor georgia
 can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned
 and to which the terms of his description apply if we therefore
 take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth we shall be
 driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the
 arms of monarchy or of splitting ourselves into an infinity of
 little jealous clashing tumultuous commonwealths the wretched
 nurseries of unceasing discord and the miserable objects of
 universal pity or contempt some of the writers who have come
 forward on the other side of the question seem to have been aware of
 the dilemma and have even been bold enough to hint at the division
 of the larger states as a desirable thing such an infatuated
 policy such a desperate expedient might by the multiplication of
 petty offices answer the views of men who possess not
 qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles
 of personal intrigue but it could never promote the greatness or
 happiness of the people of america
referring the examination of the principle itself to another
 place as has been already mentioned it will be sufficient to
 remark here that in the sense of the author who has been most
 emphatically quoted upon the occasion it would only dictate a
 reduction of the size of the more considerable members of the union
 but would not militate against their being all comprehended in one
 confederate government and this is the true question in the
 discussion of which we are at present interested
so far are the suggestions of montesquieu from standing in
 opposition to a general union of the states that he explicitly
 treats of a confederate republic as the expedient for extending the
 sphere of popular government and reconciling the advantages of
 monarchy with those of republicanism
it is very probable says he that mankind would
 have been obliged at length to live constantly under the government
 of a single person had they not contrived a kind of constitution
 that has all the internal advantages of a republican together with
 the external force of a monarchical government i mean a
 confederate republic
this form of government is a convention by which several
 smaller states agree to become members of a larger one which they
 intend to form it is a kind of assemblage of societies that
 constitute a new one capable of increasing by means of new
 associations till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be
 able to provide for the security of the united body
a republic of this kind able to withstand an external force
 may support itself without any internal corruptions the form of
 this society prevents all manner of inconveniences
if a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme
 authority he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and
 credit in all the confederate states were he to have too great
 influence over one this would alarm the rest were he to subdue a
 part that which would still remain free might oppose him with
 forces independent of those which he had usurped and overpower him
 before he could be settled in his usurpation
should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate
 states the others are able to quell it should abuses creep into
 one part they are reformed by those that remain sound the state
 may be destroyed on one side and not on the other the confederacy
 may be dissolved and the confederates preserve their sovereignty
as this government is composed of small republics it enjoys
 the internal happiness of each and with respect to its external
 situation it is possessed by means of the association of all the
 advantages of large monarchies
i have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting
 passages because they contain a luminous abridgment of the
 principal arguments in favor of the union and must effectually
 remove the false impressions which a misapplication of other parts
 of the work was calculated to make they have at the same time an
 intimate connection with the more immediate design of this paper
 which is to illustrate the tendency of the union to repress
 domestic faction and insurrection
a distinction more subtle than accurate has been raised
 between a confederacy and a consolidation of the states the
 essential characteristic of the first is said to be the restriction
 of its authority to the members in their collective capacities
 without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed it
 is contended that the national council ought to have no concern with
 any object of internal administration an exact equality of
 suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a
 leading feature of a confederate government these positions are
 in the main arbitrary they are supported neither by principle nor
 precedent it has indeed happened that governments of this kind
 have generally operated in the manner which the distinction taken
 notice of supposes to be inherent in their nature but there have
 been in most of them extensive exceptions to the practice which
 serve to prove as far as example will go that there is no absolute
 rule on the subject and it will be clearly shown in the course of
 this investigation that as far as the principle contended for has
 prevailed it has been the cause of incurable disorder and
 imbecility in the government
the definition of a confederate republic seems simply to be an
 assemblage of societies or an association of two or more states
 into one state the extent modifications and objects of the
 federal authority are mere matters of discretion so long as the
 separate organization of the members be not abolished so long as
 it exists by a constitutional necessity for local purposes
 though it should be in perfect subordination to the general
 authority of the union it would still be in fact and in theory an
 association of states or a confederacy the proposed constitution
 so far from implying an abolition of the state governments makes
 them constituent parts of the national sovereignty by allowing them
 a direct representation in the senate and leaves in their
 possession certain exclusive and very important portions of
 sovereign power this fully corresponds in every rational import
 of the terms with the idea of a federal government
in the lycian confederacy which consisted of twentythree
 cities or republics the largest were entitled to three votes in the
 common council those of the middle class to two and the smallest
 to one the common council had the appointment of all the judges
 and magistrates of the respective cities this was certainly the
 most delicate species of interference in their internal
 administration for if there be any thing that seems exclusively
 appropriated to the local jurisdictions it is the appointment of
 their own officers yet montesquieu speaking of this association
 says were i to give a model of an excellent confederate
 republic it would be that of lycia thus we perceive that the
 distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this
 enlightened civilian and we shall be led to conclude that they
 are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory

 insurrection
from the new york packet
friday november  
madison
to the people of the state of new york
among the numerous advantages promised by a wellconstructed
 union none deserves to be more accurately developed than its
 tendency to break and control the violence of faction the friend
 of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their
 character and fate as when he contemplates their propensity to this
 dangerous vice he will not fail therefore to set a due value on
 any plan which without violating the principles to which he is
 attached provides a proper cure for it the instability
 injustice and confusion introduced into the public councils have
 in truth been the mortal diseases under which popular governments
 have everywhere perished as they continue to be the favorite and
 fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their
 most specious declamations the valuable improvements made by the
 american constitutions on the popular models both ancient and
 modern cannot certainly be too much admired but it would be an
 unwarrantable partiality to contend that they have as effectually
 obviated the danger on this side as was wished and expected
 complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and
 virtuous citizens equally the friends of public and private faith
 and of public and personal liberty that our governments are too
 unstable that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of
 rival parties and that measures are too often decided not
 according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party
 but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority
 however anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no
 foundation the evidence of known facts will not permit us to deny
 that they are in some degree true it will be found indeed on a
 candid review of our situation that some of the distresses under
 which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our
 governments but it will be found at the same time that other
 causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes
 and particularly for that prevailing and increasing distrust of
 public engagements and alarm for private rights which are echoed
 from one end of the continent to the other these must be chiefly
 if not wholly effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which
 a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations
by a faction i understand a number of citizens whether
 amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole who are united
 and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest
 adversed to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and
 aggregate interests of the community
there are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction the
 one by removing its causes the other by controlling its effects
there are again two methods of removing the causes of faction
 the one by destroying the liberty which is essential to its
 existence the other by giving to every citizen the same opinions
 the same passions and the same interests
it could never be more truly said than of the first remedy that
 it was worse than the disease liberty is to faction what air is to
 fire an aliment without which it instantly expires but it could
 not be less folly to abolish liberty which is essential to
 political life because it nourishes faction than it would be to
 wish the annihilation of air which is essential to animal life
 because it imparts to fire its destructive agency
the second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be
 unwise as long as the reason of man continues fallible and he is
 at liberty to exercise it different opinions will be formed as
 long as the connection subsists between his reason and his
 selflove his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal
 influence on each other and the former will be objects to which
 the latter will attach themselves the diversity in the faculties
 of men from which the rights of property originate is not less an
 insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests the protection
 of these faculties is the first object of government from the
 protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property
 the possession of different degrees and kinds of property
 immediately results and from the influence of these on the
 sentiments and views of the respective proprietors ensues a
 division of the society into different interests and parties
the latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man
 and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of
 activity according to the different circumstances of civil society
 a zeal for different opinions concerning religion concerning
 government and many other points as well of speculation as of
 practice an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending
 for preeminence and power or to persons of other descriptions
 whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions have in
 turn divided mankind into parties inflamed them with mutual
 animosity and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress
 each other than to cooperate for their common good so strong is
 this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities that
 where no substantial occasion presents itself the most frivolous
 and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their
 unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts but
 the most common and durable source of factions has been the various
 and unequal distribution of property those who hold and those who
 are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society
 those who are creditors and those who are debtors fall under a
 like discrimination a landed interest a manufacturing interest a
 mercantile interest a moneyed interest with many lesser interests
 grow up of necessity in civilized nations and divide them into
 different classes actuated by different sentiments and views the
 regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the
 principal task of modern legislation and involves the spirit of
 party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the
 government
no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause because his
 interest would certainly bias his judgment and not improbably
 corrupt his integrity with equal nay with greater reason a body
 of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time
 yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation but so
 many judicial determinations not indeed concerning the rights of
 single persons but concerning the rights of large bodies of
 citizens and what are the different classes of legislators but
 advocates and parties to the causes which they determine is a law
 proposed concerning private debts it is a question to which the
 creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other
 justice ought to hold the balance between them yet the parties
 are and must be themselves the judges and the most numerous
 party or in other words the most powerful faction must be
 expected to prevail shall domestic manufactures be encouraged and
 in what degree by restrictions on foreign manufactures are
 questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the
 manufacturing classes and probably by neither with a sole regard to
 justice and the public good the apportionment of taxes on the
 various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require
 the most exact impartiality yet there is perhaps no legislative
 act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a
 predominant party to trample on the rules of justice every
 shilling with which they overburden the inferior number is a
 shilling saved to their own pockets
it is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to
 adjust these clashing interests and render them all subservient to
 the public good enlightened statesmen will not always be at the
 helm nor in many cases can such an adjustment be made at all
 without taking into view indirect and remote considerations which
 will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may
 find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole
the inference to which we are brought is that the causes of
 faction cannot be removed and that relief is only to be sought in
 the means of controlling its effects
if a faction consists of less than a majority relief is
 supplied by the republican principle which enables the majority to
 defeat its sinister views by regular vote it may clog the
 administration it may convulse the society but it will be unable
 to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the constitution 
 when a majority is included in a faction the form of popular
 government on the other hand enables it to sacrifice to its ruling
 passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other
 citizens to secure the public good and private rights against the
 danger of such a faction and at the same time to preserve the
 spirit and the form of popular government is then the great object
 to which our inquiries are directed let me add that it is the
 great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued
 from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored and be
 recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind
by what means is this object attainable evidently by one of
 two only either the existence of the same passion or interest in a
 majority at the same time must be prevented or the majority having
 such coexistent passion or interest must be rendered by their
 number and local situation unable to concert and carry into effect
 schemes of oppression if the impulse and the opportunity be
 suffered to coincide we well know that neither moral nor religious
 motives can be relied on as an adequate control they are not found
 to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals and lose
 their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together that
 is in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful
from this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure
 democracy by which i mean a society consisting of a small number of
 citizens who assemble and administer the government in person can
 admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction a common passion or
 interest will in almost every case be felt by a majority of the
 whole a communication and concert result from the form of
 government itself and there is nothing to check the inducements to
 sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual hence it is
 that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and
 contention have ever been found incompatible with personal
 security or the rights of property and have in general been as
 short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths
 theoretic politicians who have patronized this species of
 government have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a
 perfect equality in their political rights they would at the same
 time be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions
 their opinions and their passions
a republic by which i mean a government in which the scheme of
 representation takes place opens a different prospect and promises
 the cure for which we are seeking let us examine the points in
 which it varies from pure democracy and we shall comprehend both
 the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from
 the union
the two great points of difference between a democracy and a
 republic are first the delegation of the government in the
 latter to a small number of citizens elected by the rest
 secondly the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of
 country over which the latter may be extended
the effect of the first difference is on the one hand to
 refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the
 medium of a chosen body of citizens whose wisdom may best discern
 the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of
 justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial
 considerations under such a regulation it may well happen that
 the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people
 will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the
 people themselves convened for the purpose on the other hand the
 effect may be inverted men of factious tempers of local
 prejudices or of sinister designs may by intrigue by corruption
 or by other means first obtain the suffrages and then betray the
 interests of the people the question resulting is whether small
 or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper
 guardians of the public weal and it is clearly decided in favor of
 the latter by two obvious considerations
in the first place it is to be remarked that however small the
 republic may be the representatives must be raised to a certain
 number in order to guard against the cabals of a few and that
 however large it may be they must be limited to a certain number
 in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude hence the
 number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion
 to that of the two constituents and being proportionally greater in
 the small republic it follows that if the proportion of fit
 characters be not less in the large than in the small republic the
 former will present a greater option and consequently a greater
 probability of a fit choice
in the next place as each representative will be chosen by a
 greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic
 it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with
 success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried
 and the suffrages of the people being more free will be more
 likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and
 the most diffusive and established characters
it must be confessed that in this as in most other cases there
 is a mean on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to
 lie by enlarging too much the number of electors you render the
 representatives too little acquainted with all their local
 circumstances and lesser interests as by reducing it too much you
 render him unduly attached to these and too little fit to
 comprehend and pursue great and national objects the federal
 constitution forms a happy combination in this respect the great
 and aggregate interests being referred to the national the local
 and particular to the state legislatures
the other point of difference is the greater number of citizens
 and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of
 republican than of democratic government and it is this
 circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to
 be dreaded in the former than in the latter the smaller the
 society the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and
 interests composing it the fewer the distinct parties and
 interests the more frequently will a majority be found of the same
 party and the smaller the number of individuals composing a
 majority and the smaller the compass within which they are placed
 the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of
 oppression extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of
 parties and interests you make it less probable that a majority of
 the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other
 citizens or if such a common motive exists it will be more
 difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength and to
 act in unison with each other besides other impediments it may be
 remarked that where there is a consciousness of unjust or
 dishonorable purposes communication is always checked by distrust
 in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary
hence it clearly appears that the same advantage which a
 republic has over a democracy in controlling the effects of
 faction is enjoyed by a large over a small republicis enjoyed by
 the union over the states composing it does the advantage consist
 in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and
 virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and
 schemes of injustice it will not be denied that the representation
 of the union will be most likely to possess these requisite
 endowments does it consist in the greater security afforded by a
 greater variety of parties against the event of any one party being
 able to outnumber and oppress the rest in an equal degree does the
 increased variety of parties comprised within the union increase
 this security does it in fine consist in the greater obstacles
 opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an
 unjust and interested majority here again the extent of the
 union gives it the most palpable advantage
the influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within
 their particular states but will be unable to spread a general
 conflagration through the other states a religious sect may
 degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy
 but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must
 secure the national councils against any danger from that source a
 rage for paper money for an abolition of debts for an equal
 division of property or for any other improper or wicked project
 will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the union than a
 particular member of it in the same proportion as such a malady is
 more likely to taint a particular county or district than an entire
 state
in the extent and proper structure of the union therefore we
 behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to
 republican government and according to the degree of pleasure and
 pride we feel in being republicans ought to be our zeal in
 cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of federalists

the utility of the union in respect to commercial relations and a
 navy
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the importance of the union in a commercial light is one of
 those points about which there is least room to entertain a
 difference of opinion and which has in fact commanded the most
 general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject
 this applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries as
 with each other
there are appearances to authorize a supposition that the
 adventurous spirit which distinguishes the commercial character of
 america has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the
 maritime powers of europe they seem to be apprehensive of our too
 great interference in that carrying trade which is the support of
 their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength those
 of them which have colonies in america look forward to what this
 country is capable of becoming with painful solicitude they
 foresee the dangers that may threaten their american dominions from
 the neighborhood of states which have all the dispositions and
 would possess all the means requisite to the creation of a powerful
 marine impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy
 of fostering divisions among us and of depriving us as far as
 possible of an active commerce in our own bottoms this would
 answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their
 navigation of monopolizing the profits of our trade and of
 clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness
 did not prudence forbid the detail it would not be difficult to
 trace by facts the workings of this policy to the cabinets of
 ministers
if we continue united we may counteract a policy so unfriendly
 to our prosperity in a variety of ways by prohibitory regulations
 extending at the same time throughout the states we may oblige
 foreign countries to bid against each other for the privileges of
 our markets this assertion will not appear chimerical to those who
 are able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three
 millions of peopleincreasing in rapid progression for the most
 part exclusively addicted to agriculture and likely from local
 circumstances to remain soto any manufacturing nation and the
 immense difference there would be to the trade and navigation of
 such a nation between a direct communication in its own ships and
 an indirect conveyance of its products and returns to and from
 america in the ships of another country suppose for instance we
 had a government in america capable of excluding great britain
 with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce from all our
 ports what would be the probable operation of this step upon her
 politics would it not enable us to negotiate with the fairest
 prospect of success for commercial privileges of the most valuable
 and extensive kind in the dominions of that kingdom when these
 questions have been asked upon other occasions they have received
 a plausible but not a solid or satisfactory answer it has been
 said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the
 system of britain because she could prosecute her trade with us
 through the medium of the dutch who would be her immediate
 customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for
 the supply of our markets but would not her navigation be
 materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being
 her own carrier in that trade would not the principal part of its
 profits be intercepted by the dutch as a compensation for their
 agency and risk would not the mere circumstance of freight
 occasion a considerable deduction would not so circuitous an
 intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations by
 enhancing the price of british commodities in our markets and by
 transferring to other hands the management of this interesting
 branch of the british commerce
a mature consideration of the objects suggested by these
 questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to
 britain from such a state of things conspiring with the
 prepossessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the
 american trade and with the importunities of the west india
 islands would produce a relaxation in her present system and would
 let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those
 islands elsewhere from which our trade would derive the most
 substantial benefits such a point gained from the british
 government and which could not be expected without an equivalent in
 exemptions and immunities in our markets would be likely to have a
 correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations who would not
 be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade
a further resource for influencing the conduct of european
 nations toward us in this respect would arise from the
 establishment of a federal navy there can be no doubt that the
 continuance of the union under an efficient government would put it
 in our power at a period not very distant to create a navy which
 if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers would
 at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either
 of two contending parties this would be more peculiarly the case
 in relation to operations in the west indies a few ships of the
 line sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side would
 often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign on the event
 of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended our
 position is in this respect a most commanding one and if to this
 consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this
 country in the prosecution of military operations in the west
 indies it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable
 would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial
 privileges a price would be set not only upon our friendship but
 upon our neutrality by a steady adherence to the union we may
 hope erelong to become the arbiter of europe in america and to be
 able to incline the balance of european competitions in this part of
 the world as our interest may dictate
but in the reverse of this eligible situation we shall discover
 that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each
 other and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature
 has kindly placed within our reach in a state so insignificant our
 commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations
 at war with each other who having nothing to fear from us would
 with little scruple or remorse supply their wants by depredations
 on our property as often as it fell in their way the rights of
 neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an
 adequate power a nation despicable by its weakness forfeits even
 the privilege of being neutral
under a vigorous national government the natural strength and
 resources of the country directed to a common interest would
 baffle all the combinations of european jealousy to restrain our
 growth this situation would even take away the motive to such
 combinations by inducing an impracticability of success an active
 commerce an extensive navigation and a flourishing marine would
 then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity we might
 defy the little arts of the little politicians to control or vary
 the irresistible and unchangeable course of nature
but in a state of disunion these combinations might exist and
 might operate with success it would be in the power of the
 maritime nations availing themselves of our universal impotence to
 prescribe the conditions of our political existence and as they
 have a common interest in being our carriers and still more in
 preventing our becoming theirs they would in all probability
 combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in
 effect destroy it and confine us to a passive commerce we should
 then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our
 commodities and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to
 enrich our enemies and p rsecutors that unequaled spirit of
 enterprise which signalizes the genius of the american merchants
 and navigators and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of
 national wealth would be stifled and lost and poverty and disgrace
 would overspread a country which with wisdom might make herself
 the admiration and envy of the world
there are rights of great moment to the trade of america which
 are rights of the unioni allude to the fisheries to the navigation
 of the western lakes and to that of the mississippi the
 dissolution of the confederacy would give room for delicate
 questions concerning the future existence of these rights which
 the interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to
 our disadvantage the disposition of spain with regard to the
 mississippi needs no comment france and britain are concerned with
 us in the fisheries and view them as of the utmost moment to their
 navigation they of course would hardly remain long indifferent
 to that decided mastery of which experience has shown us to be
 possessed in this valuable branch of traffic and by which we are
 able to undersell those nations in their own markets what more
 natural than that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists
 such dangerous competitors
this branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial
 benefit all the navigating states may in different degrees
 advantageously participate in it and under circumstances of a
 greater extension of mercantile capital would not be unlikely to do
 it as a nursery of seamen it now is or when time shall have more
 nearly assimilated the principles of navigation in the several
 states will become a universal resource to the establishment of
 a navy it must be indispensable
to this great national object a navy union will contribute in
 various ways every institution will grow and flourish in
 proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentred
 towards its formation and support a navy of the united states as
 it would embrace the resources of all is an object far less remote
 than a navy of any single state or partial confederacy which would
 only embrace the resources of a single part it happens indeed
 that different portions of confederated america possess each some
 peculiar advantage for this essential establishment the more
 southern states furnish in greater abundance certain kinds of naval
 storestar pitch and turpentine their wood for the construction
 of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture the
 difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy might be
 composed if chiefly constructed of southern wood would be of
 signal importance either in the view of naval strength or of
 national economy some of the southern and of the middle states
 yield a greater plenty of iron and of better quality seamen must
 chiefly be drawn from the northern hive the necessity of naval
 protection to external or maritime commerce does not require a
 particular elucidation no more than the conduciveness of that
 species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy
an unrestrained intercourse between the states themselves will
 advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective
 productions not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home
 but for exportation to foreign markets the veins of commerce in
 every part will be replenished and will acquire additional motion
 and vigor from a free circulation of the commodities of every part
 commercial enterprise will have much greater scope from the
 diversity in the productions of different states when the staple
 of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop it can call to
 its aid the staple of another the variety not less than the
 value of products for exportation contributes to the activity of
 foreign commerce it can be conducted upon much better terms with a
 large number of materials of a given value than with a small number
 of materials of the same value arising from the competitions of
 trade and from the fluctations of markets particular articles may
 be in great demand at certain periods and unsalable at others but
 if there be a variety of articles it can scarcely happen that they
 should all be at one time in the latter predicament and on this
 account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any
 considerable obstruction or stagnation the speculative trader will
 at once perceive the force of these observations and will
 acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the united
 states would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the
 thirteen states without union or with partial unions
it may perhaps be replied to this that whether the states are
 united or disunited there would still be an intimate intercourse
 between them which would answer the same ends this intercourse
 would be fettered interrupted and narrowed by a multiplicity of
 causes which in the course of these papers have been amply detailed 
 a unity of commercial as well as political interests can only
 result from a unity of government
there are other points of view in which this subject might be
 placed of a striking and animating kind but they would lead us
 too far into the regions of futurity and would involve topics not
 proper for a newspaper discussion i shall briefly observe that
 our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an
 ascendant in the system of american affairs the world may
 politically as well as geographically be divided into four parts
 each having a distinct set of interests unhappily for the other
 three europe by her arms and by her negotiations by force and by
 fraud has in different degrees extended her dominion over them
 all africa asia and america have successively felt her
 domination the superiority she has long maintained has tempted her
 to plume herself as the mistress of the world and to consider the
 rest of mankind as created for her benefit men admired as profound
 philosophers have in direct terms attributed to her inhabitants a
 physical superiority and have gravely asserted that all animals
 and with them the human species degenerate in americathat even
 dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our
 atmosphere facts have too long supported these arrogant
 pretensions of the europeans it belongs to us to vindicate the
 honor of the human race and to teach that assuming brother
 moderation union will enable us to do it disunion will will add
 another victim to his triumphs let americans disdain to be the
 instruments of european greatness let the thirteen states bound
 together in a strict and indissoluble union concur in erecting one
 great american system superior to the control of all transatlantic
 force or influence and able to dictate the terms of the connection
 between the old and the new world

the utility of the union in respect to revenue
from the new york packet
tuesday november  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the effects of union upon the commercial prosperity of the
 states have been sufficiently delineated its tendency to promote
 the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry
the prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by
 all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most
 productive source of national wealth and has accordingly become a
 primary object of their political cares by multipying the means of
 gratification by promoting the introduction and circulation of the
 precious metals those darling objects of human avarice and
 enterprise it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of
 industry and to make them flow with greater activity and
 copiousness the assiduous merchant the laborious husbandman the
 active mechanic and the industrious manufacturerall orders of
 men look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to
 this pleasing reward of their toils the oftenagitated question
 between agriculture and commerce has from indubitable experience
 received a decision which has silenced the rivalship that once
 subsisted between them and has proved to the satisfaction of their
 friends that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven
 it has been found in various countries that in proportion as
 commerce has flourished land has risen in value and how could it
 have happened otherwise could that which procures a freer vent for
 the products of the earth which furnishes new incitements to the
 cultivation of land which is the most powerful instrument in
 increasing the quantity of money in a statecould that in fine
 which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry in every
 shape fail to augment that article which is the prolific parent of
 far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are exerted
 it is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had an
 adversary and it is one among a multitude of proofs how apt a
 spirit of illinformed jealousy or of too great abstraction and
 refinement is to lead men astray from the plainest truths of reason
 and conviction
the ability of a country to pay taxes must always be
 proportioned in a great degree to the quantity of money in
 circulation and to the celerity with which it circulates
 commerce contributing to both these objects must of necessity
 render the payment of taxes easier and facilitate the requisite
 supplies to the treasury the hereditary dominions of the emperor
 of germany contain a great extent of fertile cultivated and
 populous territory a large proportion of which is situated in mild
 and luxuriant climates in some parts of this territory are to be
 found the best gold and silver mines in europe and yet from the
 want of the fostering influence of commerce that monarch can boast
 but slender revenues he has several times been compelled to owe
 obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the
 preservation of his essential interests and is unable upon the
 strength of his own resources to sustain a long or continued war
but it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that union
 will be seen to conduce to the purpose of revenue there are other
 points of view in which its influence will appear more immediate
 and decisive it is evident from the state of the country from the
 habits of the people from the experience we have had on the point
 itself that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums
 by direct taxation tax laws have in vain been multiplied new
 methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried the
 public expectation has been uniformly disappointed and the
 treasuries of the states have remained empty the popular system of
 administration inherent in the nature of popular government
 coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and
 mutilated state of trade has hitherto defeated every experiment for
 extensive collections and has at length taught the different
 legislatures the folly of attempting them
no person acquainted with what happens in other countries will
 be surprised at this circumstance in so opulent a nation as that
 of britain where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much
 more tolerable and from the vigor of the government much more
 practicable than in america far the greatest part of the national
 revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind from imposts
 and from excises duties on imported articles form a large branch
 of this latter description
in america it is evident that we must a long time depend for
 the means of revenue chiefly on such duties in most parts of it
 excises must be confined within a narrow compass the genius of the
 people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of
 excise laws the pockets of the farmers on the other hand will
 reluctantly yield but scanty supplies in the unwelcome shape of
 impositions on their houses and lands and personal property is too
 precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way
 than by the inperceptible agency of taxes on consumption
if these remarks have any foundation that state of things which
 will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource
 must be best adapted to our political welfare and it cannot admit
 of a serious doubt that this state of things must rest on the basis
 of a general union as far as this would be conducive to the
 interests of commerce so far it must tend to the extension of the
 revenue to be drawn from that source as far as it would contribute
 to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more
 simple and efficacious so far it must serve to answer the purposes
 of making the same rate of duties more productive and of putting it
 into the power of the government to increase the rate without
 prejudice to trade
the relative situation of these states the number of rivers
 with which they are intersected and of bays that wash there shores
 the facility of communication in every direction the affinity of
 language and manners the familiar habits of intercourse all
 these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit
 trade between them a matter of little difficulty and would insure
 frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other the
 separate states or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual
 jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the
 lowness of their duties the temper of our governments for a long
 time to come would not permit those rigorous precautions by which
 the european nations guard the avenues into their respective
 countries as well by land as by water and which even there are
 found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous stratagems of
 avarice
in france there is an army of patrols as they are called
 constantly employed to secure their fiscal regulations against the
 inroads of the dealers in contraband trade mr neckar computes the
 number of these patrols at upwards of twenty thousand this shows
 the immense difficulty in preventing that species of traffic where
 there is an inland communication and places in a strong light the
 disadvantages with which the collection of duties in this country
 would be encumbered if by disunion the states should be placed in a
 situation with respect to each other resembling that of france
 with respect to her neighbors the arbitrary and vexatious powers
 with which the patrols are necessarily armed would be intolerable
 in a free country
if on the contrary there be but one government pervading all
 the states there will be as to the principal part of our commerce
 but one side to guardthe atlantic coast vessels arriving directly
 from foreign countries laden with valuable cargoes would rarely
 choose to hazard themselves to the complicated and critical perils
 which would attend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into
 port they would have to dread both the dangers of the coast and
 of detection as well after as before their arrival at the places of
 their final destination an ordinary degree of vigilance would be
 competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the
 rights of the revenue a few armed vessels judiciously stationed
 at the entrances of our ports might at a small expense be made
 useful sentinels of the laws and the government having the same
 interest to provide against violations everywhere the cooperation
 of its measures in each state would have a powerful tendency to
 render them effectual here also we should preserve by union an
 advantage which nature holds out to us and which would be
 relinquished by separation the united states lie at a great
 distance from europe and at a considerable distance from all other
 places with which they would have extensive connections of foreign
 trade the passage from them to us in a few hours or in a single
 night as between the coasts of france and britain and of other
 neighboring nations would be impracticable this is a prodigious
 security against a direct contraband with foreign countries but a
 circuitous contraband to one state through the medium of another
 would be both easy and safe the difference between a direct
 importation from abroad and an indirect importation through the
 channel of a neighboring state in small parcels according to time
 and opportunity with the additional facilities of inland
 communication must be palpable to every man of discernment
it is therefore evident that one national government would be
 able at much less expense to extend the duties on imports beyond
 comparison further than would be practicable to the states
 separately or to any partial confederacies hitherto i believe
 it may safely be asserted that these duties have not upon an
 average exceeded in any state three per cent in france they are
 estimated to be about fifteen per cent and in britain they exceed
 this proportion there seems to be nothing to hinder their
 being increased in this country to at least treble their present
 amount the single article of ardent spirits under federal
 regulation might be made to furnish a considerable revenue upon a
 ratio to the importation into this state the whole quantity
 imported into the united states may be estimated at four millions of
 gallons which at a shilling per gallon would produce two hundred
 thousand pounds that article would well bear this rate of duty
 and if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it such an
 effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture to the
 economy to the morals and to the health of the society there is
 perhaps nothing so much a subject of national extravagance as these
 spirits
what will be the consequence if we are not able to avail
 ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent a nation
 cannot long exist without revenues destitute of this essential
 support it must resign its independence and sink into the degraded
 condition of a province this is an extremity to which no
 government will of choice accede revenue therefore must be had
 at all events in this country if the principal part be not drawn
 from commerce it must fall with oppressive weight upon land it
 has been already intimated that excises in their true
 signification are too little in unison with the feelings of the
 people to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation
 nor indeed in the states where almost the sole employment is
 agriculture are the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous
 to permit very ample collections in that way personal estate as
 has been before remarked from the difficulty in tracing it cannot
 be subjected to large contributions by any other means than by
 taxes on consumption in populous cities it may be enough the
 subject of conjecture to occasion the oppression of individuals
 without much aggregate benefit to the state but beyond these
 circles it must in a great measure escape the eye and the hand of
 the taxgatherer as the necessities of the state nevertheless
 must be satisfied in some mode or other the defect of other
 resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on the
 possessors of land and as on the other hand the wants of the
 government can never obtain an adequate supply unless all the
 sources of revenue are open to its demands the finances of the
 community under such embarrassments cannot be put into a situation
 consistent with its respectability or its security thus we shall
 not even have the consolations of a full treasury to atone for the
 oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed
 in the cultivation of the soil but public and private distress
 will keep pace with each other in gloomy concert and unite in
 deploring the infatuation of those counsels which led to disunion

advantage of the union in respect to economy in government
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
as connected with the subject of revenue we may with propriety
 consider that of economy the money saved from one object may be
 usefully applied to another and there will be so much the less to
 be drawn from the pockets of the people if the states are united
 under one government there will be but one national civil list to
 support if they are divided into several confederacies there will
 be as many different national civil lists to be provided forand
 each of them as to the principal departments coextensive with that
 which would be necessary for a government of the whole the entire
 separation of the states into thirteen unconnected sovereignties is
 a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have many
 advocates the ideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of
 the empire seem generally turned toward three confederaciesone
 consisting of the four northern another of the four middle and a
 third of the five southern states there is little probability that
 there would be a greater number according to this distribution
 each confederacy would comprise an extent of territory larger than
 that of the kingdom of great britain no wellinformed man will
 suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy can be properly
 regulated by a government less comprehensive in its organs or
 institutions than that which has been proposed by the convention
 when the dimensions of a state attain to a certain magnitude it
 requires the same energy of government and the same forms of
 administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent
 this idea admits not of precise demonstration because there is no
 rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary
 to the government of any given number of individuals but when we
 consider that the island of britain nearly commensurate with each
 of the supposed confederacies contains about eight millions of
 people and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to
 direct the passions of so large a society to the public good we
 shall see no reason to doubt that the like portion of power would be
 sufficient to perform the same task in a society far more numerous
 civil power properly organized and exerted is capable of
 diffusing its force to a very great extent and can in a manner
 reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious
 arrangement of subordinate institutions
the supposition that each confederacy into which the states
 would be likely to be divided would require a government not less
 comprehensive than the one proposed will be strengthened by another
 supposition more probable than that which presents us with three
 confederacies as the alternative to a general union if we attend
 carefully to geographical and commercial considerations in
 conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different states
 we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most
 naturally league themselves under two governments the four eastern
 states from all the causes that form the links of national sympathy
 and connection may with certainty be expected to unite new york
 situated as she is would never be unwise enough to oppose a feeble
 and unsupported flank to the weight of that confederacy there are
 other obvious reasons that would facilitate her accession to it
 new jersey is too small a state to think of being a frontier in
 opposition to this still more powerful combination nor do there
 appear to be any obstacles to her admission into it even
 pennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the northern
 league an active foreign commerce on the basis of her own
 navigation is her true policy and coincides with the opinions and
 dispositions of her citizens the more southern states from
 various circumstances may not think themselves much interested in
 the encouragement of navigation they may prefer a system which
 would give unlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well
 as the purchasers of their commodities pennsylvania may not choose
 to confound her interests in a connection so adverse to her policy
 as she must at all events be a frontier she may deem it most
 consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned towards
 the weaker power of the southern rather than towards the stronger
 power of the northern confederacy this would give her the fairest
 chance to avoid being the flanders of america whatever may be the
 determination of pennsylvania if the northern confederacy includes
 new jersey there is no likelihood of more than one confederacy to
 the south of that state
nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen states will
 be able to support a national government better than one half or
 one third or any number less than the whole this reflection must
 have great weight in obviating that objection to the proposed plan
 which is founded on the principle of expense an objection
 however which when we come to take a nearer view of it will
 appear in every light to stand on mistaken ground
if in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil
 lists we take into view the number of persons who must necessarily
 be employed to guard the inland communication between the different
 confederacies against illicit trade and who in time will infallibly
 spring up out of the necessities of revenue and if we also take
 into view the military establishments which it has been shown would
 unavoidably result from the jealousies and conflicts of the several
 nations into which the states would be divided we shall clearly
 discover that a separation would be not less injurious to the
 economy than to the tranquillity commerce revenue and liberty of
 every part

objections to the proposed constitution from extent of territory
 answered
from the new york packet
friday november  
madison
to the people of the state of new york
we have seen the necessity of the union as our bulwark against
 foreign danger as the conservator of peace among ourselves as the
 guardian of our commerce and other common interests as the only
 substitute for those military establishments which have subverted
 the liberties of the old world and as the proper antidote for the
 diseases of faction which have proved fatal to other popular
 governments and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by
 our own all that remains within this branch of our inquiries is
 to take notice of an objection that may be drawn from the great
 extent of country which the union embraces a few observations on
 this subject will be the more proper as it is perceived that the
 adversaries of the new constitution are availing themselves of the
 prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere of
 republican administration in order to supply by imaginary
 difficulties the want of those solid objections which they endeavor
 in vain to find
the error which limits republican government to a narrow
 district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers i
 remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence
 chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy applying
 to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter the
 true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a
 former occasion it is that in a democracy the people meet and
 exercise the government in person in a republic they assemble and
 administer it by their representatives and agents a democracy
 consequently will be confined to a small spot a republic may be
 extended over a large region
to this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice
 of some celebrated authors whose writings have had a great share in
 forming the modern standard of political opinions being subjects
 either of an absolute or limited monarchy they have endeavored to
 heighten the advantages or palliate the evils of those forms by
 placing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican and
 by citing as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of
 ancient greece and modern italy under the confusion of names it
 has been an easy task to transfer to a republic observations
 applicable to a democracy only and among others the observation
 that it can never be established but among a small number of people
 living within a small compass of territory
such a fallacy may have been the less perceived as most of the
 popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic species
 and even in modern europe to which we owe the great principle of
 representation no example is seen of a government wholly popular
 and founded at the same time wholly on that principle if europe
 has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in
 government by the simple agency of which the will of the largest
 political body may be concentred and its force directed to any
 object which the public good requires america can claim the merit
 of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive republics 
 it is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should wish to
 deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full efficacy
 in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her
 consideration
as the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the
 central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to
 assemble as often as their public functions demand and will include
 no greater number than can join in those functions so the natural
 limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will
 barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be
 necessary for the administration of public affairs can it be said
 that the limits of the united states exceed this distance it will
 not be said by those who recollect that the atlantic coast is the
 longest side of the union that during the term of thirteen years
 the representatives of the states have been almost continually
 assembled and that the members from the most distant states are not
 chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance than those from
 the states in the neighborhood of congress
that we may form a juster estimate with regard to this
 interesting subject let us resort to the actual dimensions of the
 union the limits as fixed by the treaty of peace are on the
 east the atlantic on the south the latitude of thirtyone degrees
 on the west the mississippi and on the north an irregular line
 running in some instances beyond the fortyfifth degree in others
 falling as low as the fortysecond the southern shore of lake erie
 lies below that latitude computing the distance between the
 thirtyfirst and fortyfifth degrees it amounts to nine hundred and
 seventythree common miles computing it from thirtyone to
 fortytwo degrees to seven hundred and sixtyfour miles and a half
 taking the mean for the distance the amount will be eight hundred
 and sixtyeight miles and threefourths the mean distance from the
 atlantic to the mississippi does not probably exceed seven hundred
 and fifty miles on a comparison of this extent with that of
 several countries in europe the practicability of rendering our
 system commensurate to it appears to be demonstrable it is not a
 great deal larger than germany where a diet representing the whole
 empire is continually assembled or than poland before the late
 dismemberment where another national diet was the depositary of the
 supreme power passing by france and spain we find that in great
 britain inferior as it may be in size the representatives of the
 northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the
 national council as will be required of those of the most remote
 parts of the union
favorable as this view of the subject may be some observations
 remain which will place it in a light still more satisfactory
in the first place it is to be remembered that the general
 government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and
 administering laws its jurisdiction is limited to certain
 enumerated objects which concern all the members of the republic
 but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any
 the subordinate governments which can extend their care to all
 those other subjects which can be separately provided for will
 retain their due authority and activity were it proposed by the
 plan of the convention to abolish the governments of the particular
 states its adversaries would have some ground for their objection
 though it would not be difficult to show that if they were
 abolished the general government would be compelled by the
 principle of selfpreservation to reinstate them in their proper
 jurisdiction
a second observation to be made is that the immediate object of
 the federal constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen
 primitive states which we know to be practicable and to add to
 them such other states as may arise in their own bosoms or in their
 neighborhoods which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable the
 arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of
 our territory which lie on our northwestern frontier must be left
 to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more
 equal to the task
let it be remarked in the third place that the intercourse
 throughout the union will be facilitated by new improvements roads
 will everywhere be shortened and kept in better order
 accommodations for travelers will be multiplied and meliorated an
 interior navigation on our eastern side will be opened throughout
 or nearly throughout the whole extent of the thirteen states the
 communication between the western and atlantic districts and
 between different parts of each will be rendered more and more easy
 by those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has
 intersected our country and which art finds it so little difficult
 to connect and complete
a fourth and still more important consideration is that as
 almost every state will on one side or other be a frontier and
 will thus find in regard to its safety an inducement to make some
 sacrifices for the sake of the general protection so the states
 which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the union and
 which of course may partake least of the ordinary circulation of
 its benefits will be at the same time immediately contiguous to
 foreign nations and will consequently stand on particular
 occasions in greatest need of its strength and resources it may
 be inconvenient for georgia or the states forming our western or
 northeastern borders to send their representatives to the seat of
 government but they would find it more so to struggle alone
 against an invading enemy or even to support alone the whole
 expense of those precautions which may be dictated by the
 neighborhood of continual danger if they should derive less
 benefit therefore from the union in some respects than the less
 distant states they will derive greater benefit from it in other
 respects and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained
 throughout
i submit to you my fellowcitizens these considerations in
 full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your
 decisions will allow them their due weight and effect and that you
 will never suffer difficulties however formidable in appearance or
 however fashionable the error on which they may be founded to drive
 you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for
 disunion would conduct you hearken not to the unnatural voice
 which tells you that the people of america knit together as they
 are by so many cords of affection can no longer live together as
 members of the same family can no longer continue the mutual
 guardians of their mutual happiness can no longer be
 fellowcitizens of one great respectable and flourishing empire
 hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form
 of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the
 political world that it has never yet had a place in the theories
 of the wildest projectors that it rashly attempts what it is
 impossible to accomplish no my countrymen shut your ears against
 this unhallowed language shut your hearts against the poison which
 it conveys the kindred blood which flows in the veins of american
 citizens the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their
 sacred rights consecrate their union and excite horror at the idea
 of their becoming aliens rivals enemies and if novelties are to
 be shunned believe me the most alarming of all novelties the most
 wild of all projects the most rash of all attempts is that of
 rendering us in pieces in order to preserve our liberties and
 promote our happiness but why is the experiment of an extended
 republic to be rejected merely because it may comprise what is new
 is it not the glory of the people of america that whilst they
 have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other
 nations they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity
 for custom or for names to overrule the suggestions of their own
 good sense the knowledge of their own situation and the lessons of
 their own experience to this manly spirit posterity will be
 indebted for the possession and the world for the example of the
 numerous innovations displayed on the american theatre in favor of
 private rights and public happiness had no important step been
 taken by the leaders of the revolution for which a precedent could
 not be discovered no government established of which an exact model
 did not present itself the people of the united states might at
 this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of
 misguided councils must at best have been laboring under the weight
 of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest
 of mankind happily for america happily we trust for the whole
 human race they pursued a new and more noble course they
 accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of
 human society they reared the fabrics of governments which have no
 model on the face of the globe they formed the design of a great
 confederacy which it is incumbent on their successors to improve
 and perpetuate if their works betray imperfections we wonder at
 the fewness of them if they erred most in the structure of the
 union this was the work most difficult to be executed this is the
 work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention and
 it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide

the insufficiency of the present confederation to preserve the

for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
in the course of the preceding papers i have endeavored my
 fellowcitizens to place before you in a clear and convincing
 light the importance of union to your political safety and
 happiness i have unfolded to you a complication of dangers to
 which you would be exposed should you permit that sacred knot which
 binds the people of america together be severed or dissolved by
 ambition or by avarice by jealousy or by misrepresentation in the
 sequel of the inquiry through which i propose to accompany you the
 truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation
 from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed if the road over which
 you will still have to pass should in some places appear to you
 tedious or irksome you will recollect that you are in quest of
 information on a subject the most momentous which can engage the
 attention of a free people that the field through which you have to
 travel is in itself spacious and that the difficulties of the
 journey have been unnecessarily increased by the mazes with which
 sophistry has beset the way it will be my aim to remove the
 obstacles from your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be
 done without sacrificing utility to despatch
in pursuance of the plan which i have laid down for the
 discussion of the subject the point next in order to be examined is
 the insufficiency of the present confederation to the preservation
 of the union it may perhaps be asked what need there is of
 reasoning or proof to illustrate a position which is not either
 controverted or doubted to which the understandings and feelings of
 all classes of men assent and which in substance is admitted by the
 opponents as well as by the friends of the new constitution it
 must in truth be acknowledged that however these may differ in
 other respects they in general appear to harmonize in this
 sentiment at least that there are material imperfections in our
 national system and that something is necessary to be done to
 rescue us from impending anarchy the facts that support this
 opinion are no longer objects of speculation they have forced
 themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large and have at
 length extorted from those whose mistaken policy has had the
 principal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are
 arrived a reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in
 the scheme of our federal government which have been long pointed
 out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the union
we may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the
 last stage of national humiliation there is scarcely anything that
 can wound the pride or degrade the character of an independent
 nation which we do not experience are there engagements to the
 performance of which we are held by every tie respectable among men
 these are the subjects of constant and unblushing violation do we
 owe debts to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted in a time
 of imminent peril for the preservation of our political existence
 these remain without any proper or satisfactory provision for their
 discharge have we valuable territories and important posts in the
 possession of a foreign power which by express stipulations ought
 long since to have been surrendered these are still retained to
 the prejudice of our interests not less than of our rights are we
 in a condition to resent or to repel the aggression we have
 neither troops nor treasury nor government are we even in a
 condition to remonstrate with dignity the just imputations on our
 own faith in respect to the same treaty ought first to be removed
 are we entitled by nature and compact to a free participation in
 the navigation of the mississippi spain excludes us from it is
 public credit an indispensable resource in time of public danger
 we seem to have abandoned its cause as desperate and irretrievable
 is commerce of importance to national wealth ours is at the
 lowest point of declension is respectability in the eyes of
 foreign powers a safeguard against foreign encroachments the
 imbecility of our government even forbids them to treat with us
 our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty
 is a violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom
 of national distress the price of improved land in most parts of
 the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity
 of waste land at market and can only be fully explained by that
 want of private and public confidence which are so alarmingly
 prevalent among all ranks and which have a direct tendency to
 depreciate property of every kind is private credit the friend and
 patron of industry that most useful kind which relates to
 borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits and
 this still more from an opinion of insecurity than from the scarcity
 of money to shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford
 neither pleasure nor instruction it may in general be demanded
 what indication is there of national disorder poverty and
 insignificance that could befall a community so peculiarly blessed
 with natural advantages as we are which does not form a part of the
 dark catalogue of our public misfortunes
this is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought
 by those very maxims and councils which would now deter us from
 adopting the proposed constitution and which not content with
 having conducted us to the brink of a precipice seem resolved to
 plunge us into the abyss that awaits us below here my countrymen
 impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened
 people let us make a firm stand for our safety our tranquillity
 our dignity our reputation let us at last break the fatal charm
 which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and
 prosperity
it is true as has been before observed that facts too stubborn
 to be resisted have produced a species of general assent to the
 abstract proposition that there exist material defects in our
 national system but the usefulness of the concession on the part
 of the old adversaries of federal measures is destroyed by a
 strenuous opposition to a remedy upon the only principles that can
 give it a chance of success while they admit that the government
 of the united states is destitute of energy they contend against
 conferring upon it those powers which are requisite to supply that
 energy they seem still to aim at things repugnant and
 irreconcilable at an augmentation of federal authority without a
 diminution of state authority at sovereignty in the union and
 complete independence in the members they still in fine seem to
 cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an imperium
 in imperio this renders a full display of the principal defects
 of the confederation necessary in order to show that the evils we
 experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections but
 from fundamental errors in the structure of the building which
 cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first
 principles and main pillars of the fabric
the great and radical vice in the construction of the existing
 confederation is in the principle of legislation for states or
 governments in their corporate or collective capacities and as
 contradistinguished from the individuals of which they consist
 though this principle does not run through all the powers delegated
 to the union yet it pervades and governs those on which the
 efficacy of the rest depends except as to the rule of appointment
 the united states has an indefinite discretion to make requisitions
 for men and money but they have no authority to raise either by
 regulations extending to the individual citizens of america the
 consequence of this is that though in theory their resolutions
 concerning those objects are laws constitutionally binding on the
 members of the union yet in practice they are mere recommendations
 which the states observe or disregard at their option
it is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human
 mind that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on
 this head there should still be found men who object to the new
 constitution for deviating from a principle which has been found
 the bane of the old and which is in itself evidently incompatible
 with the idea of government a principle in short which if it is
 to be executed at all must substitute the violent and sanguinary
 agency of the sword to the mild influence of the magistracy
there is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league
 or alliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes
 precisely stated in a treaty regulating all the details of time
 place circumstance and quantity leaving nothing to future
 discretion and depending for its execution on the good faith of
 the parties compacts of this kind exist among all civilized
 nations subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and war of
 observance and nonobservance as the interests or passions of the
 contracting powers dictate in the early part of the present
 century there was an epidemical rage in europe for this species of
 compacts from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for
 benefits which were never realized with a view to establishing the
 equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the world all
 the resources of negotiation were exhausted and triple and
 quadruple alliances were formed but they were scarcely formed
 before they were broken giving an instructive but afflicting lesson
 to mankind how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which
 have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith and which
 oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of
 any immediate interest or passion
if the particular states in this country are disposed to stand
 in a similar relation to each other and to drop the project of a
 general discretionary superintendence the scheme would indeed be
 pernicious and would entail upon us all the mischiefs which have
 been enumerated under the first head but it would have the merit
 of being at least consistent and practicable abandoning all views
 towards a confederate government this would bring us to a simple
 alliance offensive and defensive and would place us in a situation
 to be alternate friends and enemies of each other as our mutual
 jealousies and rivalships nourished by the intrigues of foreign
 nations should prescribe to us
but if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation
 if we still will adhere to the design of a national government or
 which is the same thing of a superintending power under the
 direction of a common council we must resolve to incorporate into
 our plan those ingredients which may be considered as forming the
 characteristic difference between a league and a government we
 must extend the authority of the union to the persons of the
 citizens the only proper objects of government
government implies the power of making laws it is essential to
 the idea of a law that it be attended with a sanction or in
 other words a penalty or punishment for disobedience if there be
 no penalty annexed to disobedience the resolutions or commands
 which pretend to be laws will in fact amount to nothing more than
 advice or recommendation this penalty whatever it may be can
 only be inflicted in two ways by the agency of the courts and
 ministers of justice or by military force by the coercion of the
 magistracy or by the coercion of arms the first kind can
 evidently apply only to men the last kind must of necessity be
 employed against bodies politic or communities or states it is
 evident that there is no process of a court by which the observance
 of the laws can in the last resort be enforced sentences may be
 denounced against them for violations of their duty but these
 sentences can only be carried into execution by the sword in an
 association where the general authority is confined to the
 collective bodies of the communities that compose it every breach
 of the laws must involve a state of war and military execution
 must become the only instrument of civil obedience such a state of
 things can certainly not deserve the name of government nor would
 any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it
there was a time when we were told that breaches by the states
 of the regulations of the federal authority were not to be expected
 that a sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of
 the respective members and would beget a full compliance with all
 the constitutional requisitions of the union this language at the
 present day would appear as wild as a great part of what we now
 hear from the same quarter will be thought when we shall have
 received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom experience 
 it at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which
 human conduct is actuated and belied the original inducements to
 the establishment of civil power why has government been
 instituted at all because the passions of men will not conform to
 the dictates of reason and justice without constraint has it been
 found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater
 disinterestedness than individuals the contrary of this has been
 inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind and
 the inference is founded upon obvious reasons regard to reputation
 has a less active influence when the infamy of a bad action is to
 be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon one
 a spirit of faction which is apt to mingle its poison in the
 deliberations of all bodies of men will often hurry the persons of
 whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses for which
 they would blush in a private capacity
in addition to all this there is in the nature of sovereign
 power an impatience of control that disposes those who are
 invested with the exercise of it to look with an evil eye upon all
 external attempts to restrain or direct its operations from this
 spirit it happens that in every political association which is
 formed upon the principle of uniting in a common interest a number
 of lesser sovereignties there will be found a kind of eccentric
 tendency in the subordinate or inferior orbs by the operation of
 which there will be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the
 common centre this tendency is not difficult to be accounted for
 it has its origin in the love of power power controlled or
 abridged is almost always the rival and enemy of that power by which
 it is controlled or abridged this simple proposition will teach us
 how little reason there is to expect that the persons intrusted
 with the administration of the affairs of the particular members of
 a confederacy will at all times be ready with perfect goodhumor
 and an unbiased regard to the public weal to execute the
 resolutions or decrees of the general authority the reverse of
 this results from the constitution of human nature
if therefore the measures of the confederacy cannot be
 executed without the intervention of the particular administrations
 there will be little prospect of their being executed at all the
 rulers of the respective members whether they have a constitutional
 right to do it or not will undertake to judge of the propriety of
 the measures themselves they will consider the conformity of the
 thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or aims
 the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its
 adoption all this will be done and in a spirit of interested and
 suspicious scrutiny without that knowledge of national
 circumstances and reasons of state which is essential to a right
 judgment and with that strong predilection in favor of local
 objects which can hardly fail to mislead the decision the same
 process must be repeated in every member of which the body is
 constituted and the execution of the plans framed by the councils
 of the whole will always fluctuate on the discretion of the
 illinformed and prejudiced opinion of every part those who have
 been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies who have
 seen how difficult it often is where there is no exterior pressure
 of circumstances to bring them to harmonious resolutions on
 important points will readily conceive how impossible it must be to
 induce a number of such assemblies deliberating at a distance from
 each other at different times and under different impressions
 long to cooperate in the same views and pursuits
in our case the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign
 wills is requisite under the confederation to the complete
 execution of every important measure that proceeds from the union
 it has happened as was to have been foreseen the measures of the
 union have not been executed the delinquencies of the states have
 step by step matured themselves to an extreme which has at
 length arrested all the wheels of the national government and
 brought them to an awful stand congress at this time scarcely
 possess the means of keeping up the forms of administration till
 the states can have time to agree upon a more substantial substitute
 for the present shadow of a federal government things did not come
 to this desperate extremity at once the causes which have been
 specified produced at first only unequal and disproportionate
 degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the union the
 greater deficiencies of some states furnished the pretext of example
 and the temptation of interest to the complying or to the least
 delinquent states why should we do more in proportion than those
 who are embarked with us in the same political voyage why should
 we consent to bear more than our proper share of the common burden
 these were suggestions which human selfishness could not withstand
 and which even speculative men who looked forward to remote
 consequences could not without hesitation combat each state
 yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate interest or
 convenience has successively withdrawn its support till the frail
 and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon our heads and to
 crush us beneath its ruins
