 turbulent and factious seasons be violated in respect to a
 particular class of citizens by a victorious and overbearing
 majority but that so fundamental a privilege in a country so
 situated and enlightened should be invaded to the prejudice of the
 great mass of the people by the deliberate policy of the
 government without occasioning a popular revolution is altogether
 inconceivable and incredible
in addition to this general reflection there are considerations
 of a more precise nature which forbid all apprehension on the
 subject the dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose
 the national government and ustill more in the manner in which they
 will be brought into action in its various branches must form a
 powerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of
 elections there is sufficient diversity in the state of property
 in the genius manners and habits of the people of the different
 parts of the union to occasion a material diversity of disposition
 in their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions
 in society and though an intimate intercourse under the same
 government will promote a gradual assimilation in some of these
 respects yet there are causes as well physical as moral which
 may in a greater or less degree permanently nourish different
 propensities and inclinations in this respect but the circumstance
 which will be likely to have the greatest influence in the matter
 will be the dissimilar modes of constituting the several component
 parts of the government the house of representatives being to be
 elected immediately by the people the senate by the state
 legislatures the president by electors chosen for that purpose by
 the people there would be little probability of a common interest
 to cement these different branches in a predilection for any
 particular class of electors
as to the senate it is impossible that any regulation of time
 and manner which is all that is proposed to be submitted to the
 national government in respect to that body can affect the spirit
 which will direct the choice of its members the collective sense
 of the state legislatures can never be influenced by extraneous
 circumstances of that sort a consideration which alone ought to
 satisfy us that the discrimination apprehended would never be
 attempted for what inducement could the senate have to concur in a
 preference in which itself would not be included or to what
 purpose would it be established in reference to one branch of the
 legislature if it could not be extended to the other the
 composition of the one would in this case counteract that of the
 other and we can never suppose that it would embrace the
 appointments to the senate unless we can at the same time suppose
 the voluntary cooperation of the state legislatures if we make
 the latter supposition it then becomes immaterial where the power
 in question is placed whether in their hands or in those of the
 union
but what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in
 the national councils is it to be exercised in a discrimination
 between the different departments of industry or between the
 different kinds of property or between the different degrees of
 property will it lean in favor of the landed interest or the
 moneyed interest or the mercantile interest or the manufacturing
 interest or to speak in the fashionable language of the
 adversaries to the constitution will it court the elevation of
 the wealthy and the wellborn to the exclusion and debasement
 of all the rest of the society
if this partiality is to be exerted in favor of those who are
 concerned in any particular description of industry or property i
 presume it will readily be admitted that the competition for it
 will lie between landed men and merchants and i scruple not to
 affirm that it is infinitely less likely that either of them should
 gain an ascendant in the national councils than that the one or the
 other of them should predominate in all the local councils the
 inference will be that a conduct tending to give an undue
 preference to either is much less to be dreaded from the former than
 from the latter
the several states are in various degrees addicted to
 agriculture and commerce in most if not all of them agriculture
 is predominant in a few of them however commerce nearly divides
 its empire and in most of them has a considerable share of
 influence in proportion as either prevails it will be conveyed
 into the national representation and for the very reason that
 this will be an emanation from a greater variety of interests and
 in much more various proportions than are to be found in any single
 state it will be much less apt to espouse either of them with a
 decided partiality than the representation of any single state
in a country consisting chiefly of the cultivators of land
 where the rules of an equal representation obtain the landed
 interest must upon the whole preponderate in the government as
 long as this interest prevails in most of the state legislatures so
 long it must maintain a correspondent superiority in the national
 senate which will generally be a faithful copy of the majorities of
 those assemblies it cannot therefore be presumed that a sacrifice
 of the landed to the mercantile class will ever be a favorite object
 of this branch of the federal legislature in applying thus
 particularly to the senate a general observation suggested by the
 situation of the country i am governed by the consideration that
 the credulous votaries of state power cannot upon their own
 principles suspect that the state legislatures would be warped
 from their duty by any external influence but in reality the same
 situation must have the same effect in the primative composition at
 least of the federal house of representatives an improper bias
 towards the mercantile class is as little to be expected from this
 quarter as from the other
in order perhaps to give countenance to the objection at any
 rate it may be asked is there not danger of an opposite bias in
 the national government which may dispose it to endeavor to secure
 a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class as
 there is little likelihood that the supposition of such a bias will
 have any terrors for those who would be immediately injured by it a
 labored answer to this question will be dispensed with it will be
 sufficient to remark first that for the reasons elsewhere
 assigned it is less likely that any decided partiality should
 prevail in the councils of the union than in those of any of its
 members secondly that there would be no temptation to violate the
 constitution in favor of the landed class because that class would
 in the natural course of things enjoy as great a preponderancy as
 itself could desire and thirdly that men accustomed to
 investigate the sources of public prosperity upon a large scale
 must be too well convinced of the utility of commerce to be
 inclined to inflict upon it so deep a wound as would result from the
 entire exclusion of those who would best understand its interest
 from a share in the management of them the importance of commerce
 in the view of revenue alone must effectually guard it against the
 enmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor
 by the urgent calls of public necessity
i the rather consult brevity in discussing the probability of a
 preference founded upon a discrimination between the different kinds
 of industry and property because as far as i understand the
 meaning of the objectors they contemplate a discrimination of
 another kind they appear to have in view as the objects of the
 preference with which they endeavor to alarm us those whom they
 designate by the description of the wealthy and the wellborn
 these it seems are to be exalted to an odious preeminence over
 the rest of their fellowcitizens at one time however their
 elevation is to be a necessary consequence of the smallness of the
 representative body at another time it is to be effected by
 depriving the people at large of the opportunity of exercising their
 right of suffrage in the choice of that body
but upon what principle is the discrimination of the places of
 election to be made in order to answer the purpose of the meditated
 preference are the wealthy and the wellborn as they are
 called confined to particular spots in the several states have
 they by some miraculous instinct or foresight set apart in each of
 them a common place of residence are they only to be met with in
 the towns or cities or are they on the contrary scattered over
 the face of the country as avarice or chance may have happened to
 cast their own lot or that of their predecessors if the latter is
 the case as every intelligent man knows it to be is it not
 evident that the policy of confining the places of election to
 particular districts would be as subversive of its own aim as it
 would be exceptionable on every other account the truth is that
 there is no method of securing to the rich the preference
 apprehended but by prescribing qualifications of property either
 for those who may elect or be elected but this forms no part of
 the power to be conferred upon the national government its
 authority would be expressly restricted to the regulation of the
 times the places the manner of elections the qualifications of
 the persons who may choose or be chosen as has been remarked upon
 other occasions are defined and fixed in the constitution and are
 unalterable by the legislature
let it however be admitted for argument sake that the
 expedient suggested might be successful and let it at the same
 time be equally taken for granted that all the scruples which a
 sense of duty or an apprehension of the danger of the experiment
 might inspire were overcome in the breasts of the national rulers
 still i imagine it will hardly be pretended that they could ever
 hope to carry such an enterprise into execution without the aid of a
 military force sufficient to subdue the resistance of the great body
 of the people the improbability of the existence of a force equal
 to that object has been discussed and demonstrated in different
 parts of these papers but that the futility of the objection under
 consideration may appear in the strongest light it shall be
 conceded for a moment that such a force might exist and the
 national government shall be supposed to be in the actual possession
 of it what will be the conclusion with a disposition to invade
 the essential rights of the community and with the means of
 gratifying that disposition is it presumable that the persons who
 were actuated by it would amuse themselves in the ridiculous task of
 fabricating election laws for securing a preference to a favorite
 class of men would they not be likely to prefer a conduct better
 adapted to their own immediate aggrandizement would they not
 rather boldly resolve to perpetuate themselves in office by one
 decisive act of usurpation than to trust to precarious expedients
 which in spite of all the precautions that might accompany them
 might terminate in the dismission disgrace and ruin of their
 authors would they not fear that citizens not less tenacious than
 conscious of their rights would flock from the remote extremes of
 their respective states to the places of election to voerthrow
 their tyrants and to substitute men who would be disposed to avenge
 the violated majesty of the people

concerning the power of congress to regulate the election of

to the people of the state of new york
the more candid opposers of the provision respecting elections
 contained in the plan of the convention when pressed in argument
 will sometimes concede the propriety of that provision with this
 qualification however that it ought to have been accompanied with
 a declaration that all elections should be had in the counties
 where the electors resided this say they was a necessary
 precaution against an abuse of the power a declaration of this
 nature would certainly have been harmless so far as it would have
 had the effect of quieting apprehensions it might not have been
 undesirable but it would in fact have afforded little or no
 additional security against the danger apprehended and the want of
 it will never be considered by an impartial and judicious examiner
 as a serious still less as an insuperable objection to the plan
 the different views taken of the subject in the two preceding
 papers must be sufficient to satisfy all dispassionate and
 discerning men that if the public liberty should ever be the victim
 of the ambition of the national rulers the power under examination
 at least will be guiltless of the sacrifice
if those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only would
 exercise it in a careful inspection of the several state
 constitutions they would find little less room for disquietude and
 alarm from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to
 elections than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to
 the national government in the same respect a review of their
 situation in this particular would tend greatly to remove any ill
 impressions which may remain in regard to this matter but as that
 view would lead into long and tedious details i shall content
 myself with the single example of the state in which i write the
 constitution of new york makes no other provision for locality of
 elections than that the members of the assembly shall be elected in
 the counties those of the senate in the great districts into
 which the state is or may be divided these at present are four in
 number and comprehend each from two to six counties it may
 readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the
 legislature of new york to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of
 new york by confining elections to particular places than for the
 legislature of the united states to defeat the suffrages of the
 citizens of the union by the like expedient suppose for
 instance the city of albany was to be appointed the sole place of
 election for the county and district of which it is a part would
 not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors
 of the members both of the senate and assembly for that county and
 district can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote
 subdivisions of the counties of albany saratoga cambridge etc
 or in any part of the county of montgomery would take the trouble
 to come to the city of albany to give their votes for members of
 the assembly or senate sooner than they would repair to the city of
 new york to participate in the choice of the members of the federal
 house of representatives the alarming indifference discoverable in
 the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws
 which afford every facility to it furnishes a ready answer to this
 question and abstracted from any experience on the subject we
 can be at no loss to determine that when the place of election is
 at an inconvenient distance from the elector the effect upon his
 conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or
 twenty thousand miles hence it must appear that objections to the
 particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections
 will in substance apply with equal force to the modification of
 the like power in the constitution of this state and for this
 reason it will be impossible to acquit the one and to condemn the
 other a similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in
 respect to the constitutions of most of the other states
if it should be said that defects in the state constitutions
 furnish no apology for those which are to be found in the plan
 proposed i answer that as the former have never been thought
 chargeable with inattention to the security of liberty where the
 imputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be applicable to
 them also the presumption is that they are rather the cavilling
 refinements of a predetermined opposition than the wellfounded
 inferences of a candid research after truth to those who are
 disposed to consider as innocent omissions in the state
 constitutions what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the
 plan of the convention nothing can be said or at most they can
 only be asked to assign some substantial reason why the
 representatives of the people in a single state should be more
 impregnable to the lust of power or other sinister motives than
 the representatives of the people of the united states if they
 cannot do this they ought at least to prove to us that it is easier
 to subvert the liberties of three millions of people with the
 advantage of local governments to head their opposition than of two
 hundred thousand people who are destitute of that advantage and in
 relation to the point immediately under consideration they ought to
 convince us that it is less probable that a predominant faction in a
 single state should in order to maintain its superiority incline
 to a preference of a particular class of electors than that a
 similar spirit should take possession of the representatives of
 thirteen states spread over a vast region and in several respects
 distinguishable from each other by a diversity of local
 circumstances prejudices and interests
hitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the
 provision in question on the ground of theoretic propriety on that
 of the danger of placing the power elsewhere and on that of the
 safety of placing it in the manner proposed but there remains to
 be mentioned a positive advantage which will result from this
 disposition and which could not as well have been obtained from any
 other i allude to the circumstance of uniformity in the time of
 elections for the federal house of representatives it is more than
 possible that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of
 great importance to the public welfare both as a security against
 the perpetuation of the same spirit in the body and as a cure for
 the diseases of faction if each state may choose its own time of
 election it is possible there may be at least as many different
 periods as there are months in the year the times of election in
 the several states as they are now established for local purposes
 vary between extremes as wide as march and november the
 consequence of this diversity would be that there could never happen
 a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time if an
 improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it that
 spirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members as they
 come forward in succession the mass would be likely to remain
 nearly the same assimilating constantly to itself its gradual
 accretions there is a contagion in example which few men have
 sufficient force of mind to resist i am inclined to think that
 treble the duration in office with the condition of a total
 dissolution of the body at the same time might be less formidable
 to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and
 successive alterations
uniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for
 executing the idea of a regular rotation in the senate and for
 conveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each
 year
it may be asked why then could not a time have been fixed in
 the constitution as the most zealous adversaries of the plan of
 the convention in this state are in general not less zealous
 admirers of the constitution of the state the question may be
 retorted and it may be asked why was not a time for the like
 purpose fixed in the constitution of this state no better answer
 can be given than that it was a matter which might safely be
 entrusted to legislative discretion and that if a time had been
 appointed it might upon experiment have been found less
 convenient than some other time the same answer may be given to
 the question put on the other side and it may be added that the
 supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative it
 would have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish
 as a fundamental point what would deprive several states of the
 convenience of having the elections for their own governments and
 for the national government at the same epochs
publius

the senate
for the independent journal
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
having examined the constitution of the house of
 representatives and answered such of the objections against it as
 seemed to merit notice i enter next on the examination of the
 senate
the heads into which this member of the government may be
 considered are i the qualification of senators ii the
 appointment of them by the state legislatures iii the equality of
 representation in the senate iv the number of senators and the
 term for which they are to be elected v the powers vested in the
 senate
i the qualifications proposed for senators as distinguished
 from those of representatives consist in a more advanced age and a
 longer period of citizenship a senator must be thirty years of age
 at least as a representative must be twentyfive and the former
 must have been a citizen nine years as seven years are required
 for the latter the propriety of these distinctions is explained by
 the nature of the senatorial trust which requiring greater extent
 of information and tability of character requires at the same time
 that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to
 supply these advantages and which participating immediately in
 transactions with foreign nations ought to be exercised by none who
 are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits
 incident to foreign birth and education the term of nine years
 appears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of
 adopted citizens whose merits and talents may claim a share in the
 public confidence and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of
 them which might create a channel for foreign influence on the
 national councils
ii it is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of
 senators by the state legislatures among the various modes which
 might have been devised for constituting this branch of the
 government that which has been proposed by the convention is
 probably the most congenial with the public opinion it is
 recommended by the double advantage of favoring a select
 appointment and of giving to the state governments such an agency
 in the formation of the federal government as must secure the
 authority of the former and may form a convenient link between the
 two systems
iii the equality of representation in the senate is another
 point which being evidently the result of compromise between the
 opposite pretensions of the large and the small states does not
 call for much discussion if indeed it be right that among a
 people thoroughly incorporated into one nation every district ought
 to have a proportional share in the government and that among
 independent and sovereign states bound together by a simple league
 the parties however unequal in size ought to have an equal share
 in the common councils it does not appear to be without some reason
 that in a compound republic partaking both of the national and
 federal character the government ought to be founded on a mixture
 of the principles of proportional and equal representation but it
 is superfluous to try by the standard of theory a part of the
 constitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result not of
 theory but of a spirit of amity and that mutual deference and
 concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered
 indispensable a common government with powers equal to its
 objects is called for by the voice and still more loudly by the
 political situation of america a government founded on principles
 more consonant to the wishes of the larger states is not likely to
 be obtained from the smaller states the only option then for the
 former lies between the proposed government and a government still
 more objectionable under this alternative the advice of prudence
 must be to embrace the lesser evil and instead of indulging a
 fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue to
 contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify
 the sacrifice
in this spirit it may be remarked that the equal vote allowed
 to each state is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion
 of sovereignty remaining in the individual states and an instrument
 for preserving that residuary sovereignty so far the equality
 ought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small
 states since they are not less solicitous to guard by every
 possible expedient against an improper consolidation of the states
 into one simple republic
another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the
 constitution of the senate is the additional impediment it must
 prove against improper acts of legislation no law or resolution
 can now be passed without the concurrence first of a majority of
 the people and then of a majority of the states it must be
 acknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some
 instances be injurious as well as beneficial and that the peculiar
 defense which it involves in favor of the smaller states would be
 more rational if any interests common to them and distinct from
 those of the other states would otherwise be exposed to peculiar
 danger but as the larger states will always be able by their
 power over the supplies to defeat unreasonable exertions of this
 prerogative of the lesser states and as the faculty and excess of
 lawmaking seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most
 liable it is not impossible that this part of the constitution may
 be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in
 contemplation
iv the number of senators and the duration of their
 appointment come next to be considered in order to form an
 accurate judgment on both of these points it will be proper to
 inquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate and
 in order to ascertain these it will be necessary to review the
 inconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an
 institution
first it is a misfortune incident to republican
 government though in a less degree than to other governments that
 those who administer it may forget their obligations to their
 constituents and prove unfaithful to their important trust in
 this point of view a senate as a second branch of the legislative
 assembly distinct from and dividing the power with a first must
 be in all cases a salutary check on the government it doubles the
 security to the people by requiring the concurrence of two distinct
 bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy where the ambition or
 corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient this is a
 precaution founded on such clear principles and now so well
 understood in the united states that it would be more than
 superfluous to enlarge on it i will barely remark that as the
 improbability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the
 dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies it must be politic to
 distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will
 consist with a due harmony in all proper measures and with the
 genuine principles of republican government
secondly the necessity of a senate is not less indicated
 by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to
 the impulse of sudden and violent passions and to be seduced by
 factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions
 examples on this subject might be cited without number and from
 proceedings within the united states as well as from the history of
 other nations but a position that will not be contradicted need
 not be proved all that need be remarked is that a body which is
 to correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it and
 consequently ought to be less numerous it ought moreover to
 possess great firmness and consequently ought to hold its authority
 by a tenure of considerable duration
thirdly another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in
 a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of
 legislation it is not possible that an assembly of men called for
 the most part from pursuits of a private nature continued in
 appointment for a short time and led by no permanent motive to
 devote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws
 the affairs and the comprehensive interests of their country
 should if left wholly to themselves escape a variety of important
 errors in the exercise of their legislative trust it may be
 affirmed on the best grounds that no small share of the present
 embarrassments of america is to be charged on the blunders of our
 governments and that these have proceeded from the heads rather
 than the hearts of most of the authors of them what indeed are all
 the repealing explaining and amending laws which fill and
 disgrace our voluminous codes but so many monuments of deficient
 wisdom so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against
 each preceding session so many admonitions to the people of the
 value of those aids which may be expected from a wellconstituted
 senate
a good government implies two things first fidelity to the
 object of government which is the happiness of the people
 secondly a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best
 attained some governments are deficient in both these qualities
 most governments are deficient in the first i scruple not to
 assert that in american governments too little attention has been
 paid to the last the federal constitution avoids this error and
 what merits particular notice it provides for the last in a mode
 which increases the security for the first
fourthly the mutability in the public councils arising
 from a rapid succession of new members however qualified they may
 be points out in the strongest manner the necessity of some
 stable institution in the government every new election in the
 states is found to change one half of the representatives from
 this change of men must proceed a change of opinions and from a
 change of opinions a change of measures but a continual change
 even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence
 and every prospect of success the remark is verified in private
 life and becomes more just as well as more important in national
 transactions
to trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would
 fill a volume i will hint a few only each of which will be
 perceived to be a source of innumerable others
in the first place it forfeits the respect and confidence of
 other nations and all the advantages connected with national
 character an individual who is observed to be inconstant to his
 plans or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all
 is marked at once by all prudent people as a speedy victim to his
 own unsteadiness and folly his more friendly neighbors may pity
 him but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his and
 not a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of
 his one nation is to another what one individual is to another
 with this melancholy distinction perhaps that the former with
 fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter are under fewer
 restraints also from taking undue advantage from the indiscretions
 of each other every nation consequently whose affairs betray a
 want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can
 be sustained from the more systematic policy of their wiser
 neighbors but the best instruction on this subject is unhappily
 conveyed to america by the example of her own situation she finds
 that she is held in no respect by her friends that she is the
 derision of her enemies and that she is a prey to every nation
 which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and
 embarrassed affairs
the internal effects of a mutable policy are still more
 calamitous it poisons the blessing of liberty itself it will be
 of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of
 their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be
 read or so incoherent that they cannot be understood if they be
 repealed or revised before they are promulgated or undergo such
 incessant changes that no man who knows what the law is today can
 guess what it will be tomorrow law is defined to be a rule of
 action but how can that be a rule which is little known and less
 fixed
another effect of public instability is the unreasonable
 advantage it gives to the sagacious the enterprising and the
 moneyed few over the industrious and uniformed mass of the people
 every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue or in any way
 affecting the value of the different species of property presents a
 new harvest to those who watch the change and can trace its
 consequences a harvest reared not by themselves but by the toils
 and cares of the great body of their fellowcitizens this is a
 state of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws
 are made for the few not for the many
in another point of view great injury results from an unstable
 government the want of confidence in the public councils damps
 every useful undertaking the success and profit of which may depend
 on a continuance of existing arrangements what prudent merchant
 will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows
 not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be
 executed what farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the
 encouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment
 when he can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and
 advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant government
 in a word no great improvement or laudable enterprise can go
 forward which requires the auspices of a steady system of national
 policy
but the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of
 attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people
 towards a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity
 and disappoints so many of their flattering hopes no government
 any more than an individual will long be respected without being
 truly respectable nor be truly respectable without possessing a
 certain portion of order and stability
publius
federalist no 
the senate continued

a fifth desideratum illustrating the utility of a senate is
 the want of a due sense of national character without a select and
 stable member of the government the esteem of foreign powers will
 not only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy
 proceeding from the causes already mentioned but the national
 councils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the
 world which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit than
 it is to obtain its respect and confidence
an attention to the judgment of other nations is important to
 every government for two reasons the one is that independently
 of the merits of any particular plan or measure it is desirable on
 various accounts that it should appear to other nations as the
 offspring of a wise and honorable policy the second is that in
 doubtful cases particularly where the national councils may be
 warped by some strong passion or momentary interest the presumed or
 known opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide that can
 be followed what has not america lost by her want of character
 with foreign nations and how many errors and follies would she not
 have avoided if the justice and propriety of her measures had in
 every instance been previously tried by the light in which they
 would probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind
yet however requisite a sense of national character may be it
 is evident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous
 and changeable body it can only be found in a number so small that
 a sensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be
 the portion of each individual or in an assembly so durably
 invested with public trust that the pride and consequence of its
 members may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and
 prosperity of the community the halfyearly representatives of
 rhode island would probably have been little affected in their
 deliberations on the iniquitous measures of that state by arguments
 drawn from the light in which such measures would be viewed by
 foreign nations or even by the sister states whilst it can
 scarcely be doubted that if the concurrence of a select and stable
 body had been necessary a regard to national character alone would
 have prevented the calamities under which that misguided people is
 now laboring
i add as a sixth defect the want in some important cases of a
 due responsibility in the government to the people arising from
 that frequency of elections which in other cases produces this
 responsibility this remark will perhaps appear not only new but
 paradoxical it must nevertheless be acknowledged when explained
 to be as undeniable as it is important
responsibility in order to be reasonable must be limited to
 objects within the power of the responsible party and in order to
 be effectual must relate to operations of that power of which a
 ready and proper judgment can be formed by the constituents the
 objects of government may be divided into two general classes the
 one depending on measures which have singly an immediate and
 sensible operation the other depending on a succession of
 wellchosen and wellconnected measures which have a gradual and
 perhaps unobserved operation the importance of the latter
 description to the collective and permanent welfare of every
 country needs no explanation and yet it is evident that an
 assembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more
 than one or two links in a chain of measures on which the general
 welfare may essentially depend ought not to be answerable for the
 final result any more than a steward or tenant engaged for one
 year could be justly made to answer for places or improvements
 which could not be accomplished in less than half a dozen years
 nor is it possible for the people to estimate the share of
 influence which their annual assemblies may respectively have on
 events resulting from the mixed transactions of several years it
 is sufficiently difficult to preserve a personal responsibility in
 the members of a numerous body for such acts of the body as have an
 immediate detached and palpable operation on its constituents
the proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in
 the legislative department which having sufficient permanency to
 provide for such objects as require a continued attention and a
 train of measures may be justly and effectually answerable for the
 attainment of those objects
thus far i have considered the circumstances which point out the
 necessity of a wellconstructed senate only as they relate to the
 representatives of the people to a people as little blinded by
 prejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom i address i shall
 not scruple to add that such an institution may be sometimes
 necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary
 errors and delusions as the cool and deliberate sense of the
 community ought in all governments and actually will in all free
 governments ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers so
 there are particular moments in public affairs when the people
 stimulated by some irregular passion or some illicit advantage or
 misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men may call
 for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready
 to lament and condemn in these critical moments how salutary will
 be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of
 citizens in order to check the misguided career and to suspend the
 blow meditated by the people against themselves until reason
 justice and truth can regain their authority over the public mind
 what bitter anguish would not the people of athens have often
 escaped if their government had contained so provident a safeguard
 against the tyranny of their own passions popular liberty might
 then have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same
 citizens the hemlock on one day and statues on the next
it may be suggested that a people spread over an extensive
 region cannot like the crowded inhabitants of a small district be
 subject to the infection of violent passions or to the danger of
 combining in pursuit of unjust measures i am far from denying that
 this is a distinction of peculiar importance i have on the
 contrary endeavored in a former paper to show that it is one of
 the principal recommendations of a confederated republic at the
 same time this advantage ought not to be considered as superseding
 the use of auxiliary precautions it may even be remarked that the
 same extended situation which will exempt the people of america
 from some of the dangers incident to lesser republics will expose
 them to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time under the
 influence of those misrepresentations which the combined industry of
 interested men may succeed in distributing among them
it adds no small weight to all these considerations to
 recollect that history informs us of no longlived republic which
 had not a senate sparta rome and carthage are in fact the only
 states to whom that character can be applied in each of the two
 first there was a senate for life the constitution of the senate
 in the last is less known circumstantial evidence makes it
 probable that it was not different in this particular from the two
 others it is at least certain that it had some quality or other
 which rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations and that
 a smaller council drawn out of the senate was appointed not only
 for life but filled up vacancies itself these examples though as
 unfit for the imitation as they are repugnant to the genius of
 america are notwithstanding when compared with the fugitive and
 turbulent existence of other ancient republics very instructive
 proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend
 stability with liberty i am not unaware of the circumstances which
 distinguish the american from other popular governments as well
 ancient as modern and which render extreme circumspection
 necessary in reasoning from the one case to the other but after
 allowing due weight to this consideration it may still be
 maintained that there are many points of similitude which render
 these examples not unworthy of our attention many of the defects
 as we have seen which can only be supplied by a senatorial
 institution are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by
 the people and to the people themselves there are others peculiar
 to the former which require the control of such an institution
 the people can never wilfully betray their own interests but they
 may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people and
 the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative
 trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men than where the
 concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every
 public act
the difference most relied on between the american and other
 republics consists in the principle of representation which is
 the pivot on which the former move and which is supposed to have
 been unknown to the latter or at least to the ancient part of them
 the use which has been made of this difference in reasonings
 contained in former papers will have shown that i am disposed
 neither to deny its existence nor to undervalue its importance i
 feel the less restraint therefore in observing that the position
 concerning the ignorance of the ancient governments on the subject
 of representation is by no means precisely true in the latitude
 commonly given to it without entering into a disquisition which
 here would be misplaced i will refer to a few known facts in
 support of what i advance
in the most pure democracies of greece many of the executive
 functions were performed not by the people themselves but by
 officers elected by the people and representing the people in their
 executive capacity
prior to the reform of solon athens was governed by nine
 archons annually elected by the people at large the degree of
 power delegated to them seems to be left in great obscurity
 subsequent to that period we find an assembly first of four and
 afterwards of six hundred members annually elected by the people
 and partially representing them in their legislative capacity
 since they were not only associated with the people in the function
 of making laws but had the exclusive right of originating
 legislative propositions to the people the senate of carthage
 also whatever might be its power or the duration of its
 appointment appears to have been elective by the suffrages of the
 people similar instances might be traced in most if not all the
 popular governments of antiquity
lastly in sparta we meet with the ephori and in rome with the
 tribunes two bodies small indeed in numbers but annually elected
 by the whole body of the people and considered as the
 representatives of the people almost in their plenipotentiary
 capacity the cosmi of crete were also annually elected by the
 people and have been considered by some authors as an institution
 analogous to those of sparta and rome with this difference only
 that in the election of that representative body the right of
 suffrage was communicated to a part only of the people
from these facts to which many others might be added it is
 clear that the principle of representation was neither unknown to
 the ancients nor wholly overlooked in their political constitutions
 the true distinction between these and the american governments
 lies in the total exclusion of the people in their collective
 capacity from any share in the latter and not in the total
 exclusion of the representatives of the people from the
 administration of the former the distinction however thus
 qualified must be admitted to leave a most advantageous superiority
 in favor of the united states but to insure to this advantage its
 full effect we must be careful not to separate it from the other
 advantage of an extensive territory for it cannot be believed
 that any form of representative government could have succeeded
 within the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of greece
in answer to all these arguments suggested by reason
 illustrated by examples and enforced by our own experience the
 jealous adversary of the constitution will probably content himself
 with repeating that a senate appointed not immediately by the
 people and for the term of six years must gradually acquire a
 dangerous preeminence in the government and finally transform it
 into a tyrannical aristocracy
to this general answer the general reply ought to be
 sufficient that liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty
 as well as by the abuses of power that there are numerous
 instances of the former as well as of the latter and that the
 former rather than the latter are apparently most to be
 apprehended by the united states but a more particular reply may
 be given
before such a revolution can be effected the senate it is to
 be observed must in the first place corrupt itself must next
 corrupt the state legislatures must then corrupt the house of
 representatives and must finally corrupt the people at large it
 is evident that the senate must be first corrupted before it can
 attempt an establishment of tyranny without corrupting the state
 legislatures it cannot prosecute the attempt because the
 periodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole
 body without exerting the means of corruption with equal success
 on the house of representatives the opposition of that coequal
 branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt and
 without corrupting the people themselves a succession of new
 representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine
 order is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the
 proposed senate can by any possible means within the compass of
 human address arrive at the object of a lawless ambition through
 all these obstructions
if reason condemns the suspicion the same sentence is
 pronounced by experience the constitution of maryland furnishes
 the most apposite example the senate of that state is elected as
 the federal senate will be indirectly by the people and for a term
 less by one year only than the federal senate it is distinguished
 also by the remarkable prerogative of filling up its own vacancies
 within the term of its appointment and at the same time is not
 under the control of any such rotation as is provided for the
 federal senate there are some other lesser distinctions which
 would expose the former to colorable objections that do not lie
 against the latter if the federal senate therefore really
 contained the danger which has been so loudly proclaimed some
 symptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time to have been
 betrayed by the senate of maryland but no such symptoms have
 appeared on the contrary the jealousies at first entertained by
 men of the same description with those who view with terror the
 correspondent part of the federal constitution have been gradually
 extinguished by the progress of the experiment and the maryland
 constitution is daily deriving from the salutary operation of this
 part of it a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled
 by that of any state in the union
but if any thing could silence the jealousies on this subject
 it ought to be the british example the senate there instead of
 being elected for a term of six years and of being unconfined to
 particular families or fortunes is an hereditary assembly of
 opulent nobles the house of representatives instead of being
 elected for two years and by the whole body of the people is
 elected for seven years and in very great proportion by a very
 small proportion of the people here unquestionably ought to be
 seen in full display the aristocratic usurpations and tyranny which
 are at some future period to be exemplified in the united states
 unfortunately however for the antifederal argument the british
 history informs us that this hereditary assembly has not been able
 to defend itself against the continual encroachments of the house of
 representatives and that it no sooner lost the support of the
 monarch than it was actually crushed by the weight of the popular
 branch
as far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject its
 examples support the reasoning which we have employed in sparta
 the ephori the annual representatives of the people were found an
 overmatch for the senate for life continually gained on its
 authority and finally drew all power into their own hands the
 tribunes of rome who were the representatives of the people
 prevailed it is well known in almost every contest with the senate
 for life and in the end gained the most complete triumph over it
 the fact is the more remarkable as unanimity was required in every
 act of the tribunes even after their number was augmented to ten
 it proves the irresistible force possessed by that branch of a free
 government which has the people on its side to these examples
 might be added that of carthage whose senate according to the
 testimony of polybius instead of drawing all power into its vortex
 had at the commencement of the second punic war lost almost the
 whole of its original portion
besides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage
 of facts that the federal senate will never be able to transform
 itself by gradual usurpations into an independent and aristocratic
 body we are warranted in believing that if such a revolution
 should ever happen from causes which the foresight of man cannot
 guard against the house of representatives with the people on
 their side will at all times be able to bring back the constitution
 to its primitive form and principles against the force of the
 immediate representatives of the people nothing will be able to
 maintain even the constitutional authority of the senate but such a
 display of enlightened policy and attachment to the public good as
 will divide with that branch of the legislature the affections and
 support of the entire body of the people themselves

to the people of the state of new york
it is a just and not a new observation that enemies to
 particular persons and opponents to particular measures seldom
 confine their censures to such things only in either as are worthy
 of blame unless on this principle it is difficult to explain the
 motives of their conduct who condemn the proposed constitution in
 the aggregate and treat with severity some of the most
 unexceptionable articles in it
the second section gives power to the president by and with
 the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two
 thirds of the senators present concur
the power of making treaties is an important one especially as
 it relates to war peace and commerce and it should not be
 delegated but in such a mode and with such precautions as will
 afford the highest security that it will be exercised by men the
 best qualified for the purpose and in the manner most conducive to
 the public good the convention appears to have been attentive to
 both these points they have directed the president to be chosen by
 select bodies of electors to be deputed by the people for that
 express purpose and they have committed the appointment of
 senators to the state legislatures this mode has in such cases
 vastly the advantage of elections by the people in their collective
 capacity where the activity of party zeal taking the advantage of
 the supineness the ignorance and the hopes and fears of the unwary
 and interested often places men in office by the votes of a small
 proportion of the electors
as the select assemblies for choosing the president as well as
 the state legislatures who appoint the senators will in general be
 composed of the most enlightened and respectable citizens there is
 reason to presume that their attention and their votes will be
 directed to those men only who have become the most distinguished by
 their abilities and virtue and in whom the people perceive just
 grounds for confidence the constitution manifests very particular
 attention to this object by excluding men under thirtyfive from
 the first office and those under thirty from the second it
 confines the electors to men of whom the people have had time to
 form a judgment and with respect to whom they will not be liable to
 be deceived by those brilliant appearances of genius and patriotism
 which like transient meteors sometimes mislead as well as dazzle
 if the observation be well founded that wise kings will always be
 served by able ministers it is fair to argue that as an assembly
 of select electors possess in a greater degree than kings the
 means of extensive and accurate information relative to men and
 characters so will their appointments bear at least equal marks of
 discretion and discernment the inference which naturally results
 from these considerations is this that the president and senators
 so chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand
 our national interests whether considered in relation to the
 several states or to foreign nations who are best able to promote
 those interests and whose reputation for integrity inspires and
 merits confidence with such men the power of making treaties may
 be safely lodged
although the absolute necessity of system in the conduct of any
 business is universally known and acknowledged yet the high
 importance of it in national affairs has not yet become sufficiently
 impressed on the public mind they who wish to commit the power
 under consideration to a popular assembly composed of members
 constantly coming and going in quick succession seem not to
 recollect that such a body must necessarily be inadequate to the
 attainment of those great objects which require to be steadily
 contemplated in all their relations and circumstances and which can
 only be approached and achieved by measures which not only talents
 but also exact information and often much time are necessary to
 concert and to execute it was wise therefore in the convention
 to provide not only that the power of making treaties should be
 committed to able and honest men but also that they should continue
 in place a sufficient time to become perfectly acquainted with our
 national concerns and to form and introduce a a system for the
 management of them the duration prescribed is such as will give
 them an opportunity of greatly extending their political
 information and of rendering their accumulating experience more and
 more beneficial to their country nor has the convention discovered
 less prudence in providing for the frequent elections of senators in
 such a way as to obviate the inconvenience of periodically
 transferring those great affairs entirely to new men for by
 leaving a considerable residue of the old ones in place uniformity
 and order as well as a constant succession of official information
 will be preserved
there are a few who will not admit that the affairs of trade and
 navigation should be regulated by a system cautiously formed and
 steadily pursued and that both our treaties and our laws should
 correspond with and be made to promote it it is of much
 consequence that this correspondence and conformity be carefully
 maintained and they who assent to the truth of this position will
 see and confess that it is well provided for by making concurrence
 of the senate necessary both to treaties and to laws
it seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties of whatever
 nature but that perfect secrecy and immediate despatch are
 sometimes requisite these are cases where the most useful
 intelligence may be obtained if the persons possessing it can be
 relieved from apprehensions of discovery those apprehensions will
 operate on those persons whether they are actuated by mercenary or
 friendly motives and there doubtless are many of both
 descriptions who would rely on the secrecy of the president but
 who would not confide in that of the senate and still less in that
 of a large popular assembly the convention have done well
 therefore in so disposing of the power of making treaties that
 although the president must in forming them act by the advice and
 consent of the senate yet he will be able to manage the business of
 intelligence in such a manner as prudence may suggest
they who have turned their attention to the affairs of men must
 have perceived that there are tides in them tides very irregular
 in their duration strength and direction and seldom found to run
 twice exactly in the same manner or measure to discern and to
 profit by these tides in national affairs is the business of those
 who preside over them and they who have had much experience on
 this head inform us that there frequently are occasions when days
 nay even when hours are precious the loss of a battle the death
 of a prince the removal of a minister or other circumstances
 intervening to change the present posture and aspect of affairs may
 turn the most favorable tide into a course opposite to our wishes
 as in the field so in the cabinet there are moments to be seized
 as they pass and they who preside in either should be left in
 capacity to improve them so often and so essentially have we
 heretofore suffered from the want of secrecy and despatch that the
 constitution would have been inexcusably defective if no attention
 had been paid to those objects those matters which in negotiations
 usually require the most secrecy and the most despatch are those
 preparatory and auxiliary measures which are not otherwise important
 in a national view than as they tend to facilitate the attainment
 of the objects of the negotiation for these the president will
 find no difficulty to provide and should any circumstance occur
 which requires the advice and consent of the senate he may at any
 time convene them thus we see that the constitution provides that
 our negotiations for treaties shall have every advantage which can
 be derived from talents information integrity and deliberate
 investigations on the one hand and from secrecy and despatch on
 the other
but to this plan as to most others that have ever appeared
 objections are contrived and urged
some are displeased with it not on account of any errors or
 defects in it but because as the treaties when made are to have
 the force of laws they should be made only by men invested with
 legislative authority these gentlemen seem not to consider that
 the judgments of our courts and the commissions constitutionally
 given by our governor are as valid and as binding on all persons
 whom they concern as the laws passed by our legislature all
 constitutional acts of power whether in the executive or in the
 judicial department have as much legal validity and obligation as
 if they proceeded from the legislature and therefore whatever
 name be given to the power of making treaties or however obligatory
 they may be when made certain it is that the people may with much
 propriety commit the power to a distinct body from the legislature
 the executive or the judicial it surely does not follow that
 because they have given the power of making laws to the legislature
 that therefore they should likewise give them the power to do every
 other act of sovereignty by which the citizens are to be bound and
 affected
others though content that treaties should be made in the mode
 proposed are averse to their being the supreme laws of the land
 they insist and profess to believe that treaties like acts of
 assembly should be repealable at pleasure this idea seems to be
 new and peculiar to this country but new errors as well as new
 truths often appear these gentlemen would do well to reflect that
 a treaty is only another name for a bargain and that it would be
 impossible to find a nation who would make any bargain with us
 which should be binding on them absolutely but on us only so long
 and so far as we may think proper to be bound by it they who make
 laws may without doubt amend or repeal them and it will not be
 disputed that they who make treaties may alter or cancel them but
 still let us not forget that treaties are made not by only one of
 the contracting parties but by both and consequently that as the
 consent of both was essential to their formation at first so must
 it ever afterwards be to alter or cancel them the proposed
 constitution therefore has not in the least extended the
 obligation of treaties they are just as binding and just as far
 beyond the lawful reach of legislative acts now as they will be at
 any future period or under any form of government
however useful jealousy may be in republics yet when like bile
 in the natural it abounds too much in the body politic the eyes of
 both become very liable to be deceived by the delusive appearances
 which that malady casts on surrounding objects from this cause
 probably proceed the fears and apprehensions of some that the
 president and senate may make treaties without an equal eye to the
 interests of all the states others suspect that two thirds will
 oppress the remaining third and ask whether those gentlemen are
 made sufficiently responsible for their conduct whether if they
 act corruptly they can be punished and if they make
 disadvantageous treaties how are we to get rid of those treaties
as all the states are equally represented in the senate and by
 men the most able and the most willing to promote the interests of
 their constituents they will all have an equal degree of influence
 in that body especially while they continue to be careful in
 appointing proper persons and to insist on their punctual
 attendance in proportion as the united states assume a national
 form and a national character so will the good of the whole be more
 and more an object of attention and the government must be a weak
 one indeed if it should forget that the good of the whole can only
 be promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members
 which compose the whole it will not be in the power of the
 president and senate to make any treaties by which they and their
 families and estates will not be equally bound and affected with the
 rest of the community and having no private interests distinct
 from that of the nation they will be under no temptations to
 neglect the latter
as to corruption the case is not supposable he must either
 have been very unfortunate in his intercourse with the world or
 possess a heart very susceptible of such impressions who can think
 it probable that the president and two thirds of the senate will
 ever be capable of such unworthy conduct the idea is too gross and
 too invidious to be entertained but in such a case if it should
 ever happen the treaty so obtained from us would like all other
 fraudulent contracts be null and void by the law of nations
with respect to their responsibility it is difficult to
 conceive how it could be increased every consideration that can
 influence the human mind such as honor oaths reputations
 conscience the love of country and family affections and
 attachments afford security for their fidelity in short as the
 constitution has taken the utmost care that they shall be men of
 talents and integrity we have reason to be persuaded that the
 treaties they make will be as advantageous as all circumstances
 considered could be made and so far as the fear of punishment and
 disgrace can operate that motive to good behavior is amply afforded
 by the article on the subject of impeachments
publius
federalist no 
the powers of the senate continued
from the new york packet
friday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to
 the senate in a distinct capacity are comprised in their
 participation with the executive in the appointment to offices and
 in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments
 as in the business of appointments the executive will be the
 principal agent the provisions relating to it will most properly be
 discussed in the examination of that department we will
 therefore conclude this head with a view of the judicial character
 of the senate
a wellconstituted court for the trial of impeachments is an
 object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a
 government wholly elective the subjects of its jurisdiction are
 those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men or
 in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust
 they are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be
 denominated political as they relate chiefly to injuries done
 immediately to the society itself the prosecution of them for
 this reason will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole
 community and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or
 inimical to the accused in many cases it will connect itself with
 the preexisting factions and will enlist all their animosities
 partialities influence and interest on one side or on the other
 and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the
 decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of
 parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt
the delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns
 the political reputation and existence of every man engaged in the
 administration of public affairs speak for themselves the
 difficulty of placing it rightly in a government resting entirely
 on the basis of periodical elections will as readily be perceived
 when it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it
 will from that circumstance be too often the leaders or the tools
 of the most cunning or the most numerous faction and on this
 account can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality
 towards those whose conduct may be the subject of scrutiny
the convention it appears thought the senate the most fit
 depositary of this important trust those who can best discern the
 intrinsic difficulty of the thing will be least hasty in condemning
 that opinion and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the
 arguments which may be supposed to have produced it
what it may be asked is the true spirit of the institution
 itself is it not designed as a method of national inquest into the
 conduct of public men if this be the design of it who can so
 properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of
 the nation themselves it is not disputed that the power of
 originating the inquiry or in other words of preferring the
 impeachment ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the
 legislative body will not the reasons which indicate the propriety
 of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other
 branch of that body to a share of the inquiry the model from which
 the idea of this institution has been borrowed pointed out that
 course to the convention in great britain it is the province of
 the house of commons to prefer the impeachment and of the house of
 lords to decide upon it several of the state constitutions have
 followed the example as well the latter as the former seem to
 have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands
 of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the
 government is not this the true light in which it ought to be
 regarded
where else than in the senate could have been found a tribunal
 sufficiently dignified or sufficiently independent what other
 body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation
 to preserve unawed and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality
 between an individual accused and the representatives of the
 people his accusers
could the supreme court have been relied upon as answering this
 description it is much to be doubted whether the members of that
 tribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of
 fortitude as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a
 task and it is still more to be doubted whether they would
 possess the degree of credit and authority which might on certain
 occasions be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a
 decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by
 their immediate representatives a deficiency in the first would
 be fatal to the accused in the last dangerous to the public
 tranquillity the hazard in both these respects could only be
 avoided if at all by rendering that tribunal more numerous than
 would consist with a reasonable attention to economy the necessity
 of a numerous court for the trial of impeachments is equally
 dictated by the nature of the proceeding this can never be tied
 down by such strict rules either in the delineation of the offense
 by the prosecutors or in the construction of it by the judges as
 in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of
 personal security there will be no jury to stand between the
 judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law and the party
 who is to receive or suffer it the awful discretion which a court
 of impeachments must necessarily have to doom to honor or to infamy
 the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the
 community forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of
 persons
these considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a
 conclusion that the supreme court would have been an improper
 substitute for the senate as a court of impeachments there
 remains a further consideration which will not a little strengthen
 this conclusion it is this the punishment which may be the
 consequence of conviction upon impeachment is not to terminate the
 chastisement of the offender after having been sentenced to a
 prepetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence and honors and
 emoluments of his country he will still be liable to prosecution
 and punishment in the ordinary course of law would it be proper
 that the persons who had disposed of his fame and his most valuable
 rights as a citizen in one trial should in another trial for the
 same offense be also the disposers of his life and his fortune
 would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend that error in
 the first sentence would be the parent of error in the second
 sentence that the strong bias of one decision would be apt to
 overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to
 vary the complexion of another decision those who know anything of
 human nature will not hesitate to answer these questions in the
 affirmative and will be at no loss to perceive that by making the
 same persons judges in both cases those who might happen to be the
 objects of prosecution would in a great measure be deprived of the
 double security intended them by a double trial the loss of life
 and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence which in
 its terms imported nothing more than dismission from a present and
 disqualification for a future office it may be said that the
 intervention of a jury in the second instance would obviate the
 danger but juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of
 judges they are sometimes induced to find special verdicts which
 refer the main question to the decision of the court who would be
 willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury
 acting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt
would it have been an improvement of the plan to have united
 the supreme court with the senate in the formation of the court of
 impeachments this union would certainly have been attended with
 several advantages but would they not have been overbalanced by
 the signal disadvantage already stated arising from the agency of
 the same judges in the double prosecution to which the offender
 would be liable to a certain extent the benefits of that union
 will be obtained from making the chief justice of the supreme court
 the president of the court of impeachments as is proposed to be
 done in the plan of the convention while the inconveniences of an
 entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be
 substantially avoided this was perhaps the prudent mean i
 forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamor against the
 judiciary which so considerable an augmentation of its authority
 would have afforded
would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the
 trial of impeachments of persons wholly distinct from the other
 departments of the government there are weighty arguments as well
 against as in favor of such a plan to some minds it will not
 appear a trivial objection that it could tend to increase the
 complexity of the political machine and to add a new spring to the
 government the utility of which would at best be questionable but
 an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention
 is this a court formed upon such a plan would either be attended
 with a heavy expense or might in practice be subject to a variety
 of casualties and inconveniences it must either consist of
 permanent officers stationary at the seat of government and of
 course entitled to fixed and regular stipends or of certain
 officers of the state governments to be called upon whenever an
 impeachment was actually depending it will not be easy to imagine
 any third mode materially different which could rationally be
 proposed as the court for reasons already given ought to be
 numerous the first scheme will be reprobated by every man who can
 compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying
 them the second will be espoused with caution by those who will
 seriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over
 the whole union the injury to the innocent from the
 procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought
 against them the advantage to the guilty from the opportunities
 which delay would afford to intrigue and corruption and in some
 cases the detriment to the state from the prolonged inaction of men
 whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed
 them to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in
 the house of representatives though this latter supposition may
 seem harsh and might not be likely often to be verified yet it
 ought not to be forgotten that the demon of faction will at certain
 seasons extend his sceptre over all numerous bodies of men
but though one or the other of the substitutes which have been
 examined or some other that might be devised should be thought
 preferable to the plan in this respect reported by the convention
 it will not follow that the constitution ought for this reason to be
 rejected if mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of
 government until every part of it had been adjusted to the most
 exact standard of perfection society would soon become a general
 scene of anarchy and the world a desert where is the standard of
 perfection to be found who will undertake to unite the discordant
 opinions of a whole commuity in the same judgment of it and to
 prevail upon one conceited projector to renounce his infallible
 criterion for the fallible criterion of his more conceited neighbor
 to answer the purpose of the adversaries of the constitution they
 ought to prove not merely that particular provisions in it are not
 the best which might have been imagined but that the plan upon the
 whole is bad and pernicious

objections to the power of the senate to set as a court for
 impeachments further considered
from the new york packet
tuesday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
a review of the principal objections that have appeared against
 the proposed court for the trial of impeachments will not
 improbably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions
 which may still exist in regard to this matter
the first of these objections is that the provision in question
 confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body in
 violation of that important and wellestablished maxim which requires
 a separation between the different departments of power the true
 meaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another
 place and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial
 intermixture of those departments for special purposes preserving
 them in the main distinct and unconnected this partial
 intermixture is even in some cases not only proper but necessary
 to the mutual defense of the several members of the government
 against each other an absolute or qualified negative in the
 executive upon the acts of the legislative body is admitted by the
 ablest adepts in political science to be an indispensable barrier
 against the encroachments of the latter upon the former and it
 may perhaps with no less reason be contended that the powers
 relating to impeachments are as before intimated an essential
 check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the
 executive the division of them between the two branches of the
 legislature assigning to one the right of accusing to the other
 the right of judging avoids the inconvenience of making the same
 persons both accusers and judges and guards against the danger of
 persecution from the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of
 those branches as the concurrence of two thirds of the senate will
 be requisite to a condemnation the security to innocence from this
 additional circumstance will be as complete as itself can desire
it is curious to observe with what vehemence this part of the
 plan is assailed on the principle here taken notice of by men who
 profess to admire without exception the constitution of this
 state while that constitution makes the senate together with the
 chancellor and judges of the supreme court not only a court of
 impeachments but the highest judicatory in the state in all
 causes civil and criminal the proportion in point of numbers of
 the chancellor and judges to the senators is so inconsiderable
 that the judiciary authority of new york in the last resort may
 with truth be said to reside in its senate if the plan of the
 convention be in this respect chargeable with a departure from the
 celebrated maxim which has been so often mentioned and seems to be
 so little understood how much more culpable must be the
 constitution of new york
a second objection to the senate as a court of impeachments
 is that it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that
 body tending to give to the government a countenance too
 aristocratic the senate it is observed is to have concurrent
 authority with the executive in the formation of treaties and in the
 appointment to offices if say the objectors to these
 prerogatives is added that of deciding in all cases of impeachment
 it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial influence to an
 objection so little precise in itself it is not easy to find a very
 precise answer where is the measure or criterion to which we can
 appeal for determining what will give the senate too much too
 little or barely the proper degree of influence will it not be
 more safe as well as more simple to dismiss such vague and
 uncertain calculations to examine each power by itself and to
 decide on general principles where it may be deposited with most
 advantage and least inconvenience
if we take this course it will lead to a more intelligible if
 not to a more certain result the disposition of the power of
 making treaties which has obtained in the plan of the convention
 will then if i mistake not appear to be fully justified by the
 considerations stated in a former number and by others which will
 occur under the next head of our inquiries the expediency of the
 junction of the senate with the executive in the power of
 appointing to offices will i trust be placed in a light not less
 satisfactory in the disquisitions under the same head and i
 flatter myself the observations in my last paper must have gone no
 inconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy if
 practicable to find a more fit receptacle for the power of
 determining impeachments than that which has been chosen if this
 be truly the case the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of
 the senate ought to be discarded from our reasonings
but this hypothesis such as it is has already been refuted in
 the remarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the
 senators it was by them shown as well on the credit of historical
 examples as from the reason of the thing that the most popular
 branch of every government partaking of the republican genius by
 being generally the favorite of the people will be as generally a
 full match if not an overmatch for every other member of the
 government
but independent of this most active and operative principle to
 secure the equilibrium of the national house of representatives the
 plan of the convention has provided in its favor several important
 counterpoises to the additional authorities to be conferred upon the
 senate the exclusive privilege of originating money bills will
 belong to the house of representatives the same house will possess
 the sole right of instituting impeachments is not this a complete
 counterbalance to that of determining them the same house will be
 the umpire in all elections of the president which do not unite the
 suffrages of a majority of the whole number of electors a case
 which it cannot be doubted will sometimes if not frequently happen 
 the constant possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of
 influence to that body the more it is contemplated the more
 important will appear this ultimate though contingent power of
 deciding the competitions of the most illustrious citizens of the
 union for the first office in it it would not perhaps be rash to
 predict that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh
 all the peculiar attributes of the senate
a third objection to the senate as a court of impeachments is
 drawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office 
 it is imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the
 conduct of men in whose official creation they had participated
 the principle of this objection would condemn a practice which is
 to be seen in all the state governments if not in all the
 governments with which we are acquainted i mean that of rendering
 those who hold offices during pleasure dependent on the pleasure of
 those who appoint them with equal plausibility might it be alleged
 in this case that the favoritism of the latter would always be an
 asylum for the misbehavior of the former but that practice in
 contradiction to this principle proceeds upon the presumption that
 the responsibility of those who appoint for the fitness and
 competency of the persons on whom they bestow their choice and the
 interest they will have in the respectable and prosperous
 administration of affairs will inspire a sufficient disposition to
 dismiss from a share in it all such who by their conduct shall
 have proved themselves unworthy of the confidence reposed in them
 though facts may not always correspond with this presumption yet
 if it be in the main just it must destroy the supposition that
 the senate who will merely sanction the choice of the executive
 should feel a bias towards the objects of that choice strong
 enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so extraordinary as
 to have induced the representatives of the nation to become its
 accusers
if any further arguments were necessary to evince the
 improbability of such a bias it might be found in the nature of the
 agency of the senate in the business of appointments
it will be the office of the president to nominate and with
 the advice and consent of the senate to appoint there will of
 course be no exertion of choice on the part of the senate they
 may defeat one choice of the executive and oblige him to make
 another but they cannot themselves choose they can only ratify or
 reject the choice of the president they might even entertain a
 preference to some other person at the very moment they were
 assenting to the one proposed because there might be no positive
 ground of opposition to him and they could not be sure if they
 withheld their assent that the subsequent nomination would fall
 upon their own favorite or upon any other person in their
 estimation more meritorious than the one rejected thus it could
 hardly happen that the majority of the senate would feel any other
 complacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the
 appearances of merit might inspire and the proofs of the want of it
 destroy
a fourth objection to the senate in the capacity of a court of
 impeachments is derived from its union with the executive in the
 power of making treaties this it has been said would constitute
 the senators their own judges in every case of a corrupt or
 perfidious execution of that trust after having combined with the
 executive in betraying the interests of the nation in a ruinous
 treaty what prospect it is asked would there be of their being
 made to suffer the punishment they would deserve when they were
 themselves to decide upon the accusation brought against them for
 the treachery of which they have been guilty
this objection has been circulated with more earnestness and
 with greater show of reason than any other which has appeared
 against this part of the plan and yet i am deceived if it does not
 rest upon an erroneous foundation
the security essentially intended by the constitution against
 corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties is to be
 sought for in the numbers and characters of those who are to make
 them the joint agency of the chief magistrate of the union and of
 two thirds of the members of a body selected by the collective
 wisdom of the legislatures of the several states is designed to be
 the pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this
 particular the convention might with propriety have meditated the
 punishment of the executive for a deviation from the instructions
 of the senate or a want of integrity in the conduct of the
 negotiations committed to him they might also have had in view the
 punishment of a few leading individuals in the senate who should
 have prostituted their influence in that body as the mercenary
 instruments of foreign corruption but they could not with more or
 with equal propriety have contemplated the impeachment and
 punishment of two thirds of the senate consenting to an improper
 treaty than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the
 national legislature consenting to a pernicious or unconstitutional
 law a principle which i believe has never been admitted into any
 government how in fact could a majority in the house of
 representatives impeach themselves not better it is evident than
 two thirds of the senate might try themselves and yet what reason
 is there that a majority of the house of representatives
 sacrificing the interests of the society by an unjust and tyrannical
 act of legislation should escape with impunity more than two
 thirds of the senate sacrificing the same interests in an injurious
 treaty with a foreign power the truth is that in all such cases
 it is essential to the freedom and to the necessary independence of
 the deliberations of the body that the members of it should be
 exempt from punishment for acts done in a collective capacity and
 the security to the society must depend on the care which is taken
 to confide the trust to proper hands to make it their interest to
 execute it with fidelity and to make it as difficult as possible
 for them to combine in any interest opposite to that of the public
 good
so far as might concern the misbehavior of the executive in
 perverting the instructions or contravening the views of the senate
 we need not be apprehensive of the want of a disposition in that
 body to punish the abuse of their confidence or to vindicate their
 own authority we may thus far count upon their pride if not upon
 their virtue and so far even as might concern the corruption of
 leading members by whose arts and influence the majority may have
 been inveigled into measures odious to the community if the proofs
 of that corruption should be satisfactory the usual propensity of
 human nature will warrant us in concluding that there would be
 commonly no defect of inclination in the body to divert the public
 resentment from themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of
 their mismanagement and disgrace

the constitution of the executive department of the proposed
 government claims next our attention
there is hardly any part of the system which could have been
 atten ed with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this
 and there is perhaps none which has been inveighed against with
 less candor or criticised with less judgment
here the writers against the constitution seem to have taken
 pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation calculating
 upon the aversion of the people to monarchy they have endeavored to
 enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the
 intended president of the united states not merely as the embryo
 but as the fullgrown progeny of that detested parent to
 establish the pretended affinity they have not scrupled to draw
 resources even from the regions of fiction the authorities of a
 magistrate in few instances greater in some instances less than
 those of a governor of new york have been magnified into more than
 royal prerogatives he has been decorated with attributes superior
 in dignity and splendor to those of a king of great britain he has
 been shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the
 imperial purple flowing in his train he has been seated on a
 throne surrounded with minions and mistresses giving audience to
 the envoys of foreign potentates in all the supercilious pomp of
 majesty the images of asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have
 scarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated scene we have been
 taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering janizaries
 and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio
attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or it might
 rather be said to metamorphose the object render it necessary to
 take an accurate view of its real nature and form in order as well
 to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance as to unmask
 the disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit
 resemblances which have been so insidiously as well as
 industriously propagated
in the execution of this task there is no man who would not
 find it an arduous effort either to behold with moderation or to
 treat with seriousness the devices not less weak than wicked
 which have been contrived to pervert the public opinion in relation
 to the subject they so far exceed the usual though unjustifiable
 licenses of party artifice that even in a disposition the most
 candid and tolerant they must force the sentiments which favor an
 indulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to
 give place to a voluntary and unreserved indignation it is
 impossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and
 deception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of
 great britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that
 of the president of the united states it is still more impossible
 to withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients
 which have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition
in one instance which i cite as a sample of the general spirit
 the temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the president of
 the united states a power which by the instrument reported is
 expressly allotted to the executives of the individual states i
 mean the power of filling casual vacancies in the senate
this bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has
 been hazarded by a writer who whatever may be his real merit has
 had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his party and
 who upon this false and unfounded suggestion has built a series of
 observations equally false and unfounded let him now be confronted
 with the evidence of the fact and let him if he be able justify
 or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of
 truth and to the rules of fair dealing
the second clause of the second section of the second article
 empowers the president of the united states to nominate and by
 and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint
 ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the
 supreme court and all other officers of united states whose
 appointments are not in the constitution otherwise provided for and
 which shall be established by law immediately after this clause
 follows another in these words the president shall have power to
 fill up  vacancies that may happen during the recess of the
 senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of
 their next session it is from this last provision that the
 pretended power of the president to fill vacancies in the senate has
 been deduced a slight attention to the connection of the clauses
 and to the obvious meaning of the terms will satisfy us that the
 deduction is not even colorable
the first of these two clauses it is clear only provides a
 mode for appointing such officers whose appointments are not
 otherwise provided for in the constitution and which shall be
 established by law of course it cannot extend to the
 appointments of senators whose appointments are otherwise provided
 for in the constitution and who are established by the
 constitution and will not require a future establishment by law
 this position will hardly be contested
the last of these two clauses it is equally clear cannot be
 understood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the
 senate for the following reasons  first the relation in
 which that clause stands to the other which declares the general
 mode of appointing officers of the united states denotes it to be
 nothing more than a supplement to the other for the purpose of
 establishing an auxiliary method of appointment in cases to which
 the general method was inadequate the ordinary power of
 appointment is confined to the president and senate jointly and can
 therefore only be exercised during the session of the senate but
 as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually
 in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might
 happen in their recess which it might be necessary for the public
 service to fill without delay the succeeding clause is evidently
 intended to authorize the president singly to make temporary
 appointments during the recess of the senate by granting
 commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session
 secondly if this clause is to be considered as supplementary
 to the one which precedes the vacancies of which it speaks must be
 construed to relate to the officers described in the preceding
 one and this we have seen excludes from its description the
 members of the senate thirdly the time within which the
 power is to operate during the recess of the senate and the
 duration of the appointments to the end of the next session of
 that body conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision which
 if it had been intended to comprehend senators would naturally have
 referred the temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of
 the state legislatures who are to make the permanent appointments
 and not to the recess of the national senate who are to have no
 concern in those appointments and would have extended the duration
 in office of the temporary senators to the next session of the
 legislature of the state in whose representation the vacancies had
 happened instead of making it to expire at the end of the ensuing
 session of the national senate the circumstances of the body
 authorized to make the permanent appointments would of course have
 governed the modification of a power which related to the temporary
 appointments and as the national senate is the body whose
 situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the
 suggestion under examination has been founded the vacancies to
 which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in
 whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the
 president but lastly the first and second clauses of the
 third section of the first article not only obviate all possibility
 of doubt but destroy the pretext of misconception the former
 provides that the senate of the united states shall be composed
 of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature thereof
 for six years and the latter directs that if vacancies in
 that body should happen by resignation or otherwise during the
 recess of the legislature of any state the executive thereof may
 make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the
 legislature which shall then fill such vacancies here is an
 express power given in clear and unambiguous terms to the state
 executives to fill casual vacancies in the senate by temporary
 appointments which not only invalidates the supposition that the
 clause before considered could have been intended to confer that
 power upon the president of the united states but proves that this
 supposition destitute as it is even of the merit of plausibility
 must have originated in an intention to deceive the people too
 palpable to be obscured by sophistry too atrocious to be palliated
 by hypocrisy
i have taken the pains to select this instance of
 misrepresentation and to place it in a clear and strong light as
 an unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are practiced
 to prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the
 constitution submitted to the consideration of the people nor have
 i scrupled in so flagrant a case to allow myself a severity of
 animadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these
 papers i hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid
 and honest adversary of the proposed government whether language
 can furnish epithets of too much asperity for so shameless and so
 prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of america

the mode of electing the president
from the new york packet
friday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the mode of appointment of the chief magistrate of the united
 states is almost the only part of the system of any consequence
 which has escaped without severe censure or which has received the
 slightest mark of approbation from its opponents the most
 plausible of these who has appeared in print has even deigned to
 admit that the election of the president is pretty well
 guarded i venture somewhat further and hesitate not to
 affirm that if the manner of it be not perfect it is at least
 excellent it unites in an eminent degree all the advantages the
 union of which was to be wished for
it was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in
 the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be
 confided this end will be answered by committing the right of
 making it not to any preestablished body but to men chosen by the
 people for the special purpose and at the particular conjuncture
it was equally desirable that the immediate election should be
 made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the
 station and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation
 and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements
 which were proper to govern their choice a small number of
 persons selected by their fellowcitizens from the general mass
 will be most likely to possess the information and discernment
 requisite to such complicated investigations
it was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity
 as possible to tumult and disorder this evil was not least to be
 dreaded in the election of a magistrate who was to have so
 important an agency in the administration of the government as the
 president of the united states but the precautions which have been
 so happily concerted in the system under consideration promise an
 effectual security against this mischief the choice of several to
 form an intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to
 convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements
 than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the
 public wishes and as the electors chosen in each state are to
 assemble and vote in the state in which they are chosen this
 detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats
 and ferments which might be communicated from them to the people
 than if they were all to be convened at one time in one place
nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable
 obstacle should be opposed to cabal intrigue and corruption
 these most deadly adversaries of republican government might
 naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than
 one querter but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain
 an improper ascendant in our councils how could they better
 gratify this than by raising a creature of their own to the chief
 magistracy of the union but the convention have guarded against
 all danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious
 attention they have not made the appointment of the president to
 depend on any preexisting bodies of men who might be tampered with
 beforehand to prostitute their votes but they have referred it in
 the first instance to an immediate act of the people of america to
 be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and sole
 purpose of making the appointment and they have excluded from
 eligibility to this trust all those who from situation might be
 suspected of too great devotion to the president in office no
 senator representative or other person holding a place of trust or
 profit under the united states can be of the numbers of the
 electors thus without corrupting the body of the people the
 immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task
 free from any sinister bias their transient existence and their
 detached situation already taken notice of afford a satisfactory
 prospect of their continuing so to the conclusion of it the
 business of corruption when it is to embrace so considerable a
 number of men requires time as well as means nor would it be
 found easy suddenly to embark them dispersed as they would be over
 thirteen states in any combinations founded upon motives which
 though they could not properly be denominated corrupt might yet be
 of a nature to mislead them from their duty
another and no less important desideratum was that the
 executive should be independent for his continuance in office on all
 but the people themselves he might otherwise be tempted to
 sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was
 necessary to the duration of his official consequence this
 advantage will also be secured by making his reelection to depend
 on a special body of representatives deputed by the society for the
 single purpose of making the important choice
all these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by
 the convention which is that the people of each state shall
 choose a number of persons as electors equal to the number of
 senators and representatives of such state in the national
 government who shall assemble within the state and vote for some
 fit person as president their votes thus given are to be
 transmitted to the seat of the national government and the person
 who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will
 be the president but as a majority of the votes might not always
 happen to centre in one man and as it might be unsafe to permit
 less than a majority to be conclusive it is provided that in such
 a contingency the house of representatives shall select out of the
 candidates who shall have the five highest number of votes the man
 who in their opinion may be best qualified for the office
the process of election affords a moral certainty that the
 office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not
 in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications
 talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity may
 alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single
 state but it will require other talents and a different kind of
 merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole
 union or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary
 to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of
 president of the united states it will not be too strong to say
 that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station
 filled by characters preeminent for ability and virtue and this
 will be thought no inconsiderable recommendation of the
 constitution by those who are able to estimate the share which the
 executive in every government must necessarily have in its good or
 ill administration though we cannot acquiesce in the political
 heresy of the poet who says  for forms of government let fools
 contest that which is best  administered is best
 yet we may safely pronounce that the true test of a good
 government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good
 administration
the vicepresident is to be chosen in the same manner with the
 president with this difference that the senate is to do in
 respect to the former what is to be done by the house of
 representatives in respect to the latter
the appointment of an extraordinary person as vicepresident
 has been objected to as superfluous if not mischievous it has
 been alleged that it would have been preferable to have authorized
 the senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that
 description but two considerations seem to justify the ideas of
 the convention in this respect one is that to secure at all times
 the possibility of a definite resolution of the body it is
 necessary that the president should have only a casting vote and
 to take the senator of any state from his seat as senator to place
 him in that of president of the senate would be to exchange in
 regard to the state from which he came a constant for a contingent
 vote the other consideration is that as the vicepresident may
 occasionally become a substitute for the president in the supreme
 executive magistracy all the reasons which recommend the mode of
 election prescribed for the one apply with great if not with equal
 force to the manner of appointing the other it is remarkable that
 in this as in most other instances the objection which is made
 would lie against the constitution of this state we have a
 lieutenantgovernor chosen by the people at large who presides in
 the senate and is the constitutional substitute for the governor
 in casualties similar to those which would authorize the
 vicepresident to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties
 of the president

the real character of the executive
from the new york packet
friday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
i proceed now to trace the real characters of the proposed
 executive as they are marked out in the plan of the convention
 this will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the
 representations which have been made in regard to it
the first thing which strikes our attention is that the
 executive authority with few exceptions is to be vested in a
 single magistrate this will scarcely however be considered as a
 point upon which any comparison can be grounded for if in this
 particular there be a resemblance to the king of great britain
 there is not less a resemblance to the grand seignior to the khan
 of tartary to the man of the seven mountains or to the governor of
 new york
that magistrate is to be elected for four years and is to be
 reeligible as often as the people of the united states shall think
 him worthy of their confidence in these circumstances there is a
 total dissimilitude between him and a king of great britain who is
 an hereditary monarch possessing the crown as a patrimony
 descendible to his heirs forever but there is a close analogy
 between him and a governor of new york who is elected for three
 years and is reeligible without limitation or intermission if we
 consider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a
 dangerous influence in a single state than for establishing a like
 influence throughout the united states we must conclude that a
 duration of four years for the chief magistrate of the union is a
 degree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office than a
 duration of three years for a corresponding office in a single state
the president of the united states would be liable to be
 impeached tried and upon conviction of treason bribery or other
 high crimes or misdemeanors removed from office and would
 afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary
 course of law the person of the king of great britain is sacred
 and inviolable there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is
 amenable no punishment to which he can be subjected without
 involving the crisis of a national revolution in this delicate and
 important circumstance of personal responsibility the president of
 confederated america would stand upon no better ground than a
 governor of new york and upon worse ground than the governors of
 maryland and delaware
the president of the united states is to have power to return a
 bill which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature
 for reconsideration and the bill so returned is to become a law
 if upon that reconsideration it be approved by two thirds of both
 houses the king of great britain on his part has an absolute
 negative upon the acts of the two houses of parliament the disuse
 of that power for a considerable time past does not affect the
 reality of its existence and is to be ascribed wholly to the
 crowns having found the means of substituting influence to
 authority or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of
 the two houses to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which
 could seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national
 agitation the qualified negative of the president differs widely
 from this absolute negative of the british sovereign and tallies
 exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of
 this state of which the governor is a constituent part in this
 respect the power of the president would exceed that of the governor
 of new york because the former would possess singly what the
 latter shares with the chancellor and judges but it would be
 precisely the same with that of the governor of massachusetts whose
 constitution as to this article seems to have been the original
 from which the convention have copied
the president is to be the commanderinchief of the army and
 navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states
 when called into the actual service of the united states he is to
 have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the
 united states except in cases of impeachment to recommend to the
 consideration of congress such measures as he shall judge necessary
 and expedient to convene on extraordinary occasions both houses
 of the legislature or either of them and in case of disagreement
 between them with respect to the time of adjournment to adjourn
 them to such time as he shall think proper to take care that the
 laws be faithfully executed and to commission all officers of the
 united states in most of these particulars the power of the
 president will resemble equally that of the king of great britain
 and of the governor of new york the most material points of
 difference are these  first the president will have only the
 occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by
 legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the
 union the king of great britain and the governor of new york have
 at all times the entire command of all the militia within their
 several jurisdictions in this article therefore the power of the
 president would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the
 governor secondly the president is to be commanderinchief
 of the army and navy of the united states in this respect his
 authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of great
 britain but in substance much inferior to it it would amount to
 nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military
 and naval forces as first general and admiral of the confederacy
 while that of the british king extends to the declaring of war and
 to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies all which by
 the constitution under consideration would appertain to the
 legislature the governor of new york on the other hand is
 by the constitution of the state vested only with the command of its
 militia and navy but the constitutions of several of the states
 expressly declare their governors to be commandersinchief as well
 of the army as navy and it may well be a question whether those
 of new hampshire and massachusetts in particular do not in this
 instance confer larger powers upon their respective governors than
 could be claimed by a president of the united states thirdly
 the power of the president in respect to pardons would extend to
 all cases except those of impeachment the governor of new york
 may pardon in all cases even in those of impeachment except for
 treason and murder is not the power of the governor in this
 article on a calculation of political consequences greater than
 that of the president all conspiracies and plots against the
 government which have not been matured into actual treason may be
 screened from punishment of every kind by the interposition of the
 prerogative of pardoning if a governor of new york therefore
 should be at the head of any such conspiracy until the design had
 been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices
 and adherents an entire impunity a president of the union on the
 other hand though he may even pardon treason when prosecuted in
 the ordinary course of law could shelter no offender in any
 degree from the effects of impeachment and conviction would not
 the prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a
 greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise
 against the public liberty than the mere prospect of an exemption
 from death and confiscation if the final execution of the design
 upon an actual appeal to arms should miscarry would this last
 expectation have any influence at all when the probability was
 computed that the person who was to afford that exemption might
 himself be involved in the consequences of the measure and might be
 incapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired
 impunity the better to judge of this matter it will be necessary
 to recollect that by the proposed constitution the offense of
 treason is limited to levying war upon the united states and
 adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort and that
 by the laws of new york it is confined within similar bounds
 fourthly the president can only adjourn the national legislature
 in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment
 the british monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the parliament
 the governor of new york may also prorogue the legislature of this
 state for a limited time a power which in certain situations may
 be employed to very important purposes
the president is to have power with the advice and consent of
 the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators
 present concur the king of great britain is the sole and absolute
 representative of the nation in all foreign transactions he can of
 his own accord make treaties of peace commerce alliance and of
 every other description it has been insinuated that his authority
 in this respect is not conclusive and that his conventions with
 foreign powers are subject to the revision and stand in need of the
 ratification of parliament but i believe this doctrine was never
 heard of until it was broached upon the present occasion every
 jurist of that kingdom and every other man acquainted with its
 constitution knows as an established fact that the prerogative of
 making treaties exists in the crown in its utomst plentitude and
 that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most
 complete legal validity and perfection independent of any other
 sanction the parliament it is true is sometimes seen employing
 itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the
 stipulations in a new treaty and this may have possibly given
 birth to the imagination that its cooperation was necessary to the
 obligatory efficacy of the treaty but this parliamentary
 interposition proceeds from a different cause from the necessity
 of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and
 commercial laws to the changes made in them by the operation of the
 treaty and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new
 state of things to keep the machine from running into disorder in
 this respect therefore there is no comparison between the intended
 power of the president and the actual power of the british sovereign 
 the one can perform alone what the other can do only with the
 concurrence of a branch of the legislature it must be admitted
 that in this instance the power of the federal executive would
 exceed that of any state executive but this arises naturally from
 the sovereign power which relates to treaties if the confederacy
 were to be dissolved it would become a question whether the
 executives of the several states were not solely invested with that
 delicate and important prerogative
the president is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors
 and other public ministers this though it has been a rich theme
 of declamation is more a matter of dignity than of authority it
 is a circumstance which will be without consequence in the
 administration of the government and it was far more convenient
 that it should be arranged in this manner than that there should be
 a necessity of convening the legislature or one of its branches
 upon every arrival of a foreign minister though it were merely to
 take the place of a departed predecessor
the president is to nominate and with the advice and consent
 of the senate to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers
 judges of the supreme court and in general all officers of the
 united states established by law and whose appointments are not
 otherwise provided for by the constitution the king of great
 britain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor he
 not only appoints to all offices but can create offices he can
 confer titles of nobility at pleasure and has the disposal of an
 immense number of church preferments there is evidently a great
 inferiority in the power of the president in this particular to
 that of the british king nor is it equal to that of the governor
 of new york if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution
 of the state by the practice which has obtained under it the power
 of appointment is with us lodged in a council composed of the
 governor and four members of the senate chosen by the assembly
 the governor claims and has frequently exercised the right of
 nomination and is entitled to a casting vote in the appointment
 if he really has the right of nominating his authority is in this
 respect equal to that of the president and exceeds it in the
 article of the casting vote in the national government if the
 senate should be divided no appointment could be made in the
 government of new york if the council should be divided the
 governor can turn the scale and confirm his own nomination
 if we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode
 of appointment by the president and an entire branch of the national
 legislature with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the
 governor of new york closeted in a secret apartment with at most
 four and frequently with only two persons and if we at the same
 time consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small
 number of which a council of appointment consists than the
 considerable number of which the national senate would consist we
 cannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate
 of this state in the disposition of offices must in practice be
 greatly superior to that of the chief magistrate of the union
hence it appears that except as to the concurrent authority of
 the president in the article of treaties it would be difficult to
 determine whether that magistrate would in the aggregate possess
 more or less power than the governor of new york and it appears
 yet more unequivocally that there is no pretense for the parallel
 which has been attempted between him and the king of great britain
 but to render the contrast in this respect still more striking it
 may be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude
 into a closer group
the president of the united states would be an officer elected
 by the people for four years the king of great britain is a
 perpetual and hereditary prince the one would be amenable to
 personal punishment and disgrace the person of the other is sacred
 and inviolable the one would have a qualified negative upon the
 acts of the legislative body the other has an absolute negative
 the one would have a right to command the military and naval forces
 of the nation the other in addition to this right possesses that
 of declaring war and of raising and regulating fleets and armies by
 his own authority the one would have a concurrent power with a
 branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties the other
 is the sole possessor of the power of making treaties the one
 would have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices
 the other is the sole author of all appointments the one can
 confer no privileges whatever the other can make denizens of
 aliens noblemen of commoners can erect corporations with all the
 rights incident to corporate bodies the one can prescribe no rules
 concerning the commerce or currency of the nation the other is in
 several respects the arbiter of commerce and in this capacity can
 establish markets and fairs can regulate weights and measures can
 lay embargoes for a limited time can coin money can authorize or
 prohibit the circulation of foreign coin the one has no particle
 of spiritual jurisdiction the other is the supreme head and
 governor of the national church what answer shall we give to those
 who would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other
 the same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a
 government the whole power of which would be in the hands of the
 elective and periodical servants of the people is an aristocracy a
 monarchy and a despotism
publius
 a writer in a pennsylvania paper under the signature of
 tamony has asserted that the king of great britain oweshis
 prerogative as commanderinchief to an annual mutiny bill the
 truth is on the contrary that his prerogative in this respect is
 immenmorial and was only disputed contrary to all reason and
 precedent as blackstone vol i page  expresses it by the
 long parliament of charles i but by the statute the th of charles
 ii chap  it was declared to be in the king alone for that the
 sole supreme government and command of the militia within his
 majestys realms and dominions and of all forces by sea and land
 and of all forts and places of strength ever was and is the
 undoubted right of his majesty and his royal predecessors kings and
 queens of england and that both or either house of parliament
 cannot nor ought to pretend to the same
 vide blackstones commentaries vol i p 
 candor however demands an acknowledgment that i do not think
 the claim of the governor to a right of nomination well founded
 yet it is always justifiable to reason from the practice of a
 government till its propriety has been constitutionally questioned
 and independent of this claim when we take into view the other
 considerations and pursue them through all their consequences we
 shall be inclined to draw much the same conclusion
there are two slightly different versions of no  included here

the executive department further considered
from the new york packet
tuesday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
there is an idea which is not without its advocates that a
 vigorous executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican
 government the enlightened wellwishers to this species of
 government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of
 foundation since they can never admit its truth without at the
 same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles
 energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of
 good government it is essential to the protection of the community
 against foreign attacks it is not less essential to the steady
 administration of the laws to the protection of property against
 those irregular and highhanded combinations which sometimes
 interrupt the ordinary course of justice to the security of
 liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition of
 faction and of anarchy every man the least conversant in roman
 story knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in
 the absolute power of a single man under the formidable title of
 dictator as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who
 aspired to the tyranny and the seditions of whole classes of the
 community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government
 as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the
 conquest and destruction of rome
there can be no need however to multiply arguments or examples
 on this head a feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the
 government a feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad
 execution and a government ill executed whatever it may be in
 theory must be in practice a bad government
taking it for granted therefore that all men of sense will
 agree in the necessity of an energetic executive it will only
 remain to inquire what are the ingredients which constitute this
 energy how far can they be combined with those other ingredients
 which constitute safety in the republican sense and how far does
 this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by
 the convention
the ingredients which constitute energy in the executive are
 first unity secondly duration thirdly an adequate provision
 for its support fourthly competent powers
the ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense
 are first a due dependence on the people secondly a due
 responsibility
those politicians and statesmen who have been the most
 celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice
 of their views have declared in favor of a single executive and a
 numerous legislature they have with great propriety considered
 energy as the most necessary qualification of the former and have
 regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand while
 they have with equal propriety considered the latter as best
 adapted to deliberation and wisdom and best calculated to
 conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their
 privileges and interests
that unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed
 decision activity secrecy and despatch will generally
 characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent
 degree than the proceedings of any greater number and in
 proportion as the number is increased these qualities will be
 diminished
this unity may be destroyed in two ways either by vesting the
 power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority or
 by vesting it ostensibly in one man subject in whole or in part
 to the control and cooperation of others in the capacity of
 counsellors to him of the first the two consuls of rome may serve
 as an example of the last we shall find examples in the
 constitutions of several of the states new york and new jersey if
 i recollect right are the only states which have intrusted the
 executive authority wholly to single men both these methods
 of destroying the unity of the executive have their partisans but
 the votaries of an executive council are the most numerous they
 are both liable if not to equal to similar objections and may in
 most lights be examined in conjunction
the experience of other nations will afford little instruction
 on this head as far however as it teaches any thing it teaches
 us not to be enamoured of plurality in the executive we have seen
 that the achaeans on an experiment of two praetors were induced to
 abolish one the roman history records many instances of mischiefs
 to the republic from the dissensions between the consuls and
 between the military tribunes who were at times substituted for the
 consuls but it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages
 derived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those
 magistrates that the dissensions between them were not more
 frequent or more fatal is a matter of astonishment until we advert
 to the singular position in which the republic was almost
 continually placed and to the prudent policy pointed out by the
 circumstances of the state and pursued by the consuls of making a
 division of the government between them the patricians engaged in
 a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of
 their ancient authorities and dignities the consuls who were
 generally chosen out of the former body were commonly united by the
 personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their
 order in addition to this motive of union after the arms of the
 republic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire it
 became an established custom with the consuls to divide the
 administration between themselves by lot one of them remaining at
 rome to govern the city and its environs the other taking the
 command in the more distant provinces this expedient must no
 doubt have had great influence in preventing those collisions and
 rivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the
 republic
but quitting the dim light of historical research attaching
 ourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good se se we shall
 discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of
 plurality in the executive under any modification whatever
wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common
 enterprise or pursuit there is always danger of difference of
 opinion if it be a public trust or office in which they are
 clothed with equal dignity and authority there is peculiar danger
 of personal emulation and even animosity from either and
 especially from all these causes the most bitter dissensions are
 apt to spring whenever these happen they lessen the
 respectability weaken the authority and distract the plans and
 operation of those whom they divide if they should unfortunately
 assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country consisting of
 a plurality of persons they might impede or frustrate the most
 important measures of the government in the most critical
 emergencies of the state and what is still worse they might split
 the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions
 adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the
 magistracy
men often oppose a thing merely because they have had no agency
 in planning it or because it may have been planned by those whom
 they dislike but if they have been consulted and have happened to
 disapprove opposition then becomes in their estimation an
 indispensable duty of selflove they seem to think themselves
 bound in honor and by all the motives of personal infallibility to
 defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their
 sentiments men of upright benevolent tempers have too many
 opportunities of remarking with horror to what desperate lengths
 this disposition is sometimes carried and how often the great
 interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity to the conceit
 and to the obstinacy of individuals who have credit enough to make
 their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind perhaps
 the question now before the public may in its consequences afford
 melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty or
 rather detestable vice in the human character
upon the principles of a free government inconveniences from
 the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the
 formation of the legislature but it is unnecessary and therefore
 unwise to introduce them into the constitution of the executive
 it is here too that they may be most pernicious in the
 legislature promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a
 benefit the differences of opinion and the jarrings of parties in
 that department of the government though they may sometimes
 obstruct salutary plans yet often promote deliberation and
 circumspection and serve to check excesses in the majority when a
 resolution too is once taken the opposition must be at an end
 that resolution is a law and resistance to it punishable but no
 favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of
 dissension in the executive department here they are pure and
 unmixed there is no point at which they cease to operate they
 serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure
 to which they relate from the first step to the final conclusion of
 it they constantly counteract those qualities in the executive
 which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition vigor
 and expedition and this without anycounterbalancing good in the
 conduct of war in which the energy of the executive is the bulwark
 of the national security every thing would be to be apprehended
 from its plurality
it must be confessed that these observations apply with
 principal weight to the first case supposed that is to a plurality
 of magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme the
 advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect but
 they apply though not with equal yet with considerable weight to
 the project of a council whose concurrence is made constitutionally
 necessary to the operations of the ostensible executive an artful
 cabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the
 whole system of administration if no such cabal should exist the
 mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to
 tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of
 habitual feebleness and dilatoriness
but one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the
 executive and which lies as much against the last as the first
 plan is that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility 
 responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment the
 first is the more important of the two especially in an elective
 office man in public trust will much oftener act in such a
 manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted than
 in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment but
 the multiplication of the executive adds to the difficulty of
 detection in either case it often becomes impossible amidst
 mutual accusations to determine on whom the blame or the punishment
 of a pernicious measure or series of pernicious measures ought
 really to fall it is shifted from one to another with so much
 dexterity and under such plausible appearances that the public
 opinion is left in suspense about the real author the
 circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or
 misfortune are sometimes so complicated that where there are a
 number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of
 agency though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been
 mismanagement yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose
 account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable
i was overruled by my council the council were so divided in
 their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better
 resolution on the point these and similar pretexts are
 constantly at hand whether true or false and who is there that
 will either take the trouble or incur the odium of a strict
 scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction should there
 be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task
 if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned how
 easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity as to
 render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those
 parties
in the single instance in which the governor of this state is
 coupled with a council that is in the appointment to offices we
 have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration
 scandalous appointments to important offices have been made some
 cases indeed have been so flagrant that all parties have agreed in
 the impropriety of the thing when inquiry has been made the blame
 has been laid by the governor on the members of the council who on
 their part have charged it upon his nomination while the people
 remain altogether at a loss to determine by whose influence their
 interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so
 manifestly improper in tenderness to individuals i forbear to
 descend to particulars
it is evident from these considerations that the plurality of
 the executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest
 securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated
 power first the restraints of public opinion which lose their
 efficacy as well on account of the division of the censure
 attendant on bad measures among a number as on account of the
 uncertainty on whom it ought to fall and secondly the
 opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the
 misconduct of the persons they trust in order either to their
 removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which
 admit of it
in england the king is a perpetual magistrate and it is a
 maxim which has obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace that he
 is unaccountable for his administration and his person sacred
 nothing therefore can be wiser in that kingdom than to annex to
 the king a constitutional council who may be responsible to the
 nation for the advice they give without this there would be no
 responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea
 inadmissible in a free government but even there the king is not
 bound by the resolutions of his council though they are answerable
 for the advice they give he is the absolute master of his own
 conduct in the exercise of his office and may observe or disregard
 the counsel given to him at his sole discretion
but in a republic where every magistrate ought to be personally
 responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the
 british constitution dictates the propriety of a council not only
 ceases to apply but turns against the institution in the monarchy
 of great britain it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited
 responsibility of the chief magistrate which serves in some degree
 as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior in the
 american republic it would serve to destroy or would greatly
 diminish the intended and necessary responsibility of the chief
 magistrate himself
the idea of a council to the executive which has so generally
 obtained in the state constitutions has been derived from that
 maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the
 hands of a number of men than of a single man if the maxim should
 be admitted to be applicable to the case i should contend that the
 advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous
 disadvantages on the opposite side but i do not think the rule at
 all applicable to the executive power i clearly concur in opinion
 in this particular with a writer whom the celebrated junius
 pronounces to be deep solid and ingenious that the
 executive power is more easily confined when it is one that
 it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy
 and watchfulness of the people and in a word that all
 multiplication of the executive is rather dangerous than friendly to
 liberty
a little consideration will satisfy us that the species of
 security sought for in the multiplication of the executive is
 nattainable numbers must be so great as to render combination
 difficult or they are rather a source of danger than of security
 the united credit and influence of several individuals must be more
 formidable to liberty than the credit and influence of either of
 them separately when power therefore is placed in the hands of
 so small a number of men as to admit of their interests and views
 being easily combined in a common enterprise by an artful leader
 it becomes more liable to abuse and more dangerous when abused
 than if it be lodged in the hands of one man who from the very
 circumstance of his being alone will be more narrowly watched and
 more readily suspected and who cannot unite so great a mass of
 influence as when he is associated with others the decemvirs of
 rome whose name denotes their number were more to be dreaded
 in their usurpation than any one of them would have been no person
 would think of proposing an executive much more numerous than that
 body from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the
 council the extreme of these numbers is not too great for an easy
 combination and from such a combination america would have more to
 fear than from the ambition of any single individual a council to
 a magistrate who is himself responsible for what he does are
 generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions are
 often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost
 always a cloak to his faults
i forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense though it be
 evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the
 principal end aimed at by the institution the salaries of the
 members who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of
 government would form an item in the catalogue of public
 expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal
 utility i will only add that prior to the appearance of the
 constitution i rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the
 states who did not admit as the result of experience that the
 unity of the executive of this state was one of the best of the
 distinguishing features of our constitution

 the multiplication of the executive adds to the difficulty of
 detection in either case it often becomes impossible amidst
 mutual accusations to determine on whom the blame or the punishment
 of a pernicious measure or series of pernicious measures ought
 really to fall it is shifted from one to another with so much
 dexterity and under such plausible appearances that the public
 opinion is left in suspense about the real author the
 circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or
 misfortune are sometimes so complicated that where there are a
 number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of
 agency though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been
 mismanagement yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose
 account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable
i was overruled by my council the council were so divided in
 their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better
 resolution on the point these and similar pretexts are
 constantly at hand whether true or false and who is there that
 will either take the trouble or incur the odium of a strict
 scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction should there
 be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task
 if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned how
 easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity as to
 render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those
 parties
in the single instance in which the governor of this state is
 coupled with a council that is in the appointment to offices we
 have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration
 scandalous appointments to important offices have been made some
 cases indeed have been so flagrant that all parties have agreed in
 the impropriety of the thing when inquiry has been made the blame
 has been laid by the governor on the members of the council who on
 their part have charged it upon his nomination while the people
 remain altogether at a loss to determine by whose influence their
 interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so
 manifestly improper in tenderness to individuals i forbear to
 descend to particulars
it is evident from these considerations that the plurality of
 the executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest
 securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated
 power first the restraints of public opinion which lose their
 efficacy as well on account of the division of the censure
 attendant on bad measures among a number as on account of the
 uncertainty on whom it ought to fall and secondly the
 opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the
 misconduct of the persons they trust in order either to their
 removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which
 admit of it
in england the king is a perpetual magistrate and it is a
 maxim which has obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace that he
 is unaccountable for his administration and his person sacred
 nothing therefore can be wiser in that kingdom than to annex to
 the king a constitutional council who may be responsible to the
 nation for the advice they give without this there would be no
 responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea
 inadmissible in a free government but even there the king is not
 bound by the resolutions of his council though they are answerable
 for the advice they give he is the absolute master of his own
 conduct in the exercise of his office and may observe or disregard
 the counsel given to him at his sole discretion
but in a republic where every magistrate ought to be personally
 responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the
 british constitution dictates the propriety of a council not only
 ceases to apply but turns against the institution in the monarchy
 of great britain it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited
 responsibility of the chief magistrate which serves in some degree
 as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior in the
 american republic it would serve to destroy or would greatly
 diminish the intended and necessary responsibility of the chief
 magistrate himself
the idea of a council to the executive which has so generally
 obtained in the state constitutions has been derived from that
 maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the
 hands of a number of men than of a single man if the maxim should
 be admitted to be applicable to the case i should contend that the
 advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous
 disadvantages on the opposite side but i do not think the rule at
 all applicable to the executive power i clearly concur in opinion
 in this particular with a writer whom the celebrated junius
 pronounces to be deep solid and ingenious that the
 executive power is more easily confined when it is one that
 it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy
 and watchfulness of the people and in a word that all
 multiplication of the executive is rather dangerous than friendly to
 liberty
a little consideration will satisfy us that the species of
 security sought for in the multiplication of the executive is
 nattainable numbers must be so great as to render combination
 difficult or they are rather a source of danger than of security
 the united credit and influence of several individuals must be more
 formidable to liberty than the credit and influence of either of
 them separately when power therefore is placed in the hands of
 so small a number of men as to admit of their interests and views
 being easily combined in a common enterprise by an artful leader
 it becomes more liable to abuse and more dangerous when abused
 than if it be lodged in the hands of one man who from the very
 circumstance of his being alone will be more narrowly watched and
 more readily suspected and who cannot unite so great a mass of
 influence as when he is associated with others the decemvirs of
 rome whose name denotes their number were more to be dreaded
 in their usurpation than any one of them would have been no person
 would think of proposing an executive much more numerous than that
 body from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the
 council the extreme of these numbers is not too great for an easy
 combination and from such a combination america would have more to
 fear than from the ambition of any single individual a council to
 a magistrate who is himself responsible for what he does are
 generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions are
 often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost
 always a cloak to his faults
i forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense though it be
 evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the
 principal end aimed at by the institution the salaries of the
 members who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of
 government would form an item in the catalogue of public
 expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal
 utility i will only add that prior to the appearance of the
 constitution i rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the
 states who did not admit as the result of experience that the
 unity of the executive of this state was one of the best of the
 distinguishing features of our constitution

the duration in office of the executive
from the new york packet
tuesday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
duration in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to
 the energy of the executive authority this has relation to two
 objects to the personal firmness of the executive magistrate in
 the employment of his constitutional powers and to the stability
 of the system of administration which may have been adopted under
 his auspices with regard to the first it must be evident that
 the longer the duration in office the greater will be the
 probability of obtaining so important an advantage it is a general
 principle of human nature that a man will be interested in whatever
 he possesses in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the
 tenure by which he holds it will be less attached to what he holds
 by a momentary or uncertain title than to what he enjoys by a
 durable or certain title and of course will be willing to risk
 more for the sake of the one than for the sake of the other this
 remark is not less applicable to a political privilege or honor or
 trust than to any article of ordinary property the inference from
 it is that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate under
 a consciousness that in a very short time he must lay down his
 office will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to
 hazard any material censure or perplexity from the independent
 exertion of his powers or from encountering the illhumors however
 transient which may happen to prevail either in a considerable
 part of the society itself or even in a predominant faction in the
 legislative body if the case should only be that he might lay it
 down unless continued by a new choice and if he should be desirous
 of being continued his wishes conspiring with his fears would
 tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity or debase his
 fortitude in either case feebleness and irresolution must be the
 characteristics of the station
there are some who would be inclined to regard the servile
 pliancy of the executive to a prevailing current either in the
 community or in the legislature as its best recommendation but
 such men entertain very crude notions as well of the purposes for
 which government was instituted as of the true means by which the
 public happiness may be promoted the republican principle demands
 that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct
 of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs but
 it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden
 breeze of passion or to every transient impulse which the people
 may receive from the arts of men who flatter their prejudices to
 betray their interests it is a just observation that the people
 commonly intend the public good this often applies to their very
 errors but their good sense would despise the adulator who should
 pretend that they always reason right about the means of promoting
 it they know from experience that they sometimes err and the
 wonder is that they so seldom err as they do beset as they
 continually are by the wiles of parasites and sycophants by the
 snares of the ambitious the avaricious the desperate by the
 artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve
 it and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it
 when occasions present themselves in which the interests of the
 people are at variance with their inclinations it is the duty of
 the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those
 interests to withstand the temporary delusion in order to give
 them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection
 instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved
 the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes and
 has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had
 courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their
 displeasure
but however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded
 complaisance in the executive to the inclinations of the people we
 can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors
 of the legislature the latter may sometimes stand in opposition to
 the former and at other times the people may be entirely neutral
 in either supposition it is certainly desirable that the executive
 should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor
 and decision
the same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between
 the various branches of power teaches us likewise that this
 partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent
 of the other to what purpose separate the executive or the
 judiciary from the legislative if both the executive and the
 judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of
 the legislative such a separation must be merely nominal and
 incapable of producing the ends for which it was established it is
 one thing to be subordinate to the laws and another to be dependent
 on the legislative body the first comports with the last
 violates the fundamental principles of good government and
 whatever may be the forms of the constitution unites all power in
 the same hands the tendency of the legislative authority to absorb
 every other has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in
 some preceding numbers in governments purely republican this
 tendency is almost irresistible the representatives of the people
 in a popular assembly seem sometimes to fancy that they are the
 people themselves and betray strong symptoms of impatience and
 disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter as
 if the exercise of its rights by either the executive or judiciary
 were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity
 they often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the
 other departments and as they commonly have the people on their
 side they always act with such momentum as to make it very
 difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the
 balance of the constitution
it may perhaps be asked how the shortness of the duration in
 office can affect the independence of the executive on the
 legislature unless the one were possessed of the power of
 appointing or displacing the other one answer to this inquiry may
 be drawn from the principle already remarked that is from the
 slender interest a man is apt to take in a shortlived advantage
 and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself on
 account of it to any considerable inconvenience or hazard another
 answer perhaps more obvious though not more conclusive will
 result from the consideration of the influence of the legislative
 body over the people which might be employed to prevent the
 reelection of a man who by an upright resistance to any sinister
 project of that body should have made himself obnoxious to its
 resentment
it may be asked also whether a duration of four years would
 answer the end proposed and if it would not whether a less
 period which would at least be recommended by greater security
 against ambitious designs would not for that reason be preferable
 to a longer period which was at the same time too short for the
 purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the
 magistrate
it cannot be affirmed that a duration of four years or any
 other limited duration would completely answer the end proposed
 but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a
 material influence upon the spirit and character of the government
 between the commencement and termination of such a period there
 would always be a considerable interval in which the prospect of
 annihilation would be sufficiently remote not to have an improper
 effect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of
 fortitude and in which he might reasonably promise himself that
 there would be time enough before it arrived to make the community
 sensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to pursue 
 though it be probable that as he approached the moment when the
 public were by a new election to signify their sense of his
 conduct his confidence and with it his firmness would decline
 yet both the one and the other would derive support from the
 opportunities which his previous continuance in the station had
 afforded him of establishing himself in the esteem and goodwill of
 his constituents he might then hazard with safety in proportion
 to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity and to the
 title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his
 fellowcitizens as on the one hand a duration of four years will
 contribute to the firmness of the executive in a sufficient degree
 to render it a very valuable ingredient in the composition so on
 the other it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public
 liberty if a british house of commons from the most feeble
 beginnings from the mere power of assenting or disagreeing to the
 imposition of a new tax have by rapid strides reduced the
 prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within
 the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a
 free government while they raised themselves to the rank and
 consequence of a coequal branch of the legislature if they have
 been able in one instance to abolish both the royalty and the
 aristocracy and to overturn all the ancient establishments as well
 in the church as state if they have been able on a recent
 occasion to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an
 innovation attempted by them what would be to be feared from
 an elective magistrate of four years duration with the confined
 authorities of a president of the united states what but that he
 might be unequal to the task which the constitution assigns him i
 shall only add that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of
 his firmness that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his
 encroachments

the same subject continued and reeligibility of the executive
 considered
from the new york packet
friday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the administration of government in its largest sense
 comprehends all the operations of the body politic whether
 legislative executive or judiciary but in its most usual and
 perhaps its most precise signification it is limited to executive
 details and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive
 department the actual conduct of foreign negotiations the
 preparatory plans of finance the application and disbursement of
 the public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the
 legislature the arrangement of the army and navy the directions of
 the operations of war these and other matters of a like nature
 constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the
 administration of government the persons therefore to whose
 immediate management these different matters are committed ought to
 be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate
 and on this account they ought to derive their offices from his
 appointment at least from his nomination and ought to be subject
 to his superintendence this view of the subject will at once
 suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the
 executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of
 administration to reverse and undo what has been done by a
 predecessor is very often considered by a successor as the best
 proof he can give of his own capacity and desert and in addition
 to this propensity where the alteration has been the result of
 public choice the person substituted is warranted in supposing that
 the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to
 his measures and that the less he resembles him the more he will
 recommend himself to the favor of his constituents these
 considerations and the influence of personal confidences and
 attachments would be likely to induce every new president to
 promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations and these
 causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous
 mutability in the administration of the government
with a positive duration of considerable extent i connect the
 circumstance of reeligibility the first is necessary to give to
 the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his
 part well and to the community time and leisure to observe the
 tendency of his measures and thence to form an experimental
 estimate of their merits the last is necessary to enable the
 people when they see reason to approve of his conduct to continue
 him in his station in order to prolong the utility of his talents
 and virtues and to secure to the government the advantage of
 permanency in a wise system of administration
nothing appears more plausible at first sight nor more
 illfounded upon close inspection than a scheme which in relation
 to the present point has had some respectable advocates i mean that
 of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time and
 then excluding him from it either for a limited period or forever
 after this exclusion whether temporary or perpetual would have
 nearly the same effects and these effects would be for the most
 part rather pernicious than salutary
one ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the
 inducements to good behavior there are few men who would not feel
 much less zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious
 that the advantages of the station with which it was connected must
 be relinquished at a determinate period than when they were
 permitted to entertain a hope of obtaining by meriting a
 continuance of them this position will not be disputed so long as
 it is admitted that the desire of reward is one of the strongest
 incentives of human conduct or that the best security for the
 fidelity of mankind is to make their interests coincide with their
 duty even the love of fame the ruling passion of the noblest
 minds which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and
 arduous enterprises for the public benefit requiring considerable
 time to mature and perfect them if he could flatter himself with
 the prospect of being allowed to finish what he had begun would on
 the contrary deter him from the undertaking when he foresaw that
 he must quit the scene before he could accomplish the work and must
 commit that together with his own reputation to hands which might
 be unequal or unfriendly to the task the most to be expected from
 the generality of men in such a situation is the negative merit of
 not doing harm instead of the positive merit of doing good
another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to
 sordid views to peculation and in some instances to usurpation
 an avaricious man who might happen to fill the office looking
 forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments
 he enjoyed would feel a propensity not easy to be resisted by such
 a man to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it
 lasted and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt
 expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory
 though the same man probably with a different prospect before
 him might content himself with the regular perquisites of his
 situation and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of
 an abuse of his opportunities his avarice might be a guard upon
 his avarice add to this that the same man might be vain or
 ambitious as well as avaricious and if he could expect to prolong
 his honors by his good conduct he might hesitate to sacrifice his
 appetite for them to his appetite for gain but with the prospect
 before him of approaching an inevitable annihilation his avarice
 would be likely to get the victory over his caution his vanity or
 his ambition
an ambitious man too when he found himself seated on the
 summit of his countrys honors when he looked forward to the time
 at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever and
 reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from
 the unwelcome reverse such a man in such a situation would be
 much more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for
 attempting the prolongation of his power at every personal hazard
 than if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing
 his duty
would it promote the peace of the community or the stability of
 the government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to
 be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy wandering among the
 people like discontented ghosts and sighing for a place which they
 were destined never more to possess
a third ill effect of the exclusion would be the depriving the
 community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief
 magistrate in the exercise of his office that experience is the
 parent of wisdom is an adage the truth of which is recognized by
 the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind what more desirable
 or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations
 where more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate
 of a nation can it be wise to put this desirable and essential
 quality under the ban of the constitution and to declare that the
 moment it is acquired its possessor shall be compelled to abandon
 the station in which it was acquired and to which it is adapted
 this nevertheless is the precise import of all those regulations
 which exclude men from serving their country by the choice of their
 fellowcitizens after they have by a course of service fitted
 themselves for doing it with a greater degree of utility
a fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men
 from stations in which in certain emergencies of the state their
 presence might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or
 safety there is no nation which has not at one period or another
 experienced an absolute necessity of the services of particular men
 in particular situations perhaps it would not be too strong to
 say to the preservation of its political existence how unwise
 therefore must be every such selfdenying ordinance as serves to
 prohibit a nation from making use of its own citizens in the manner
 best suited to its exigencies and circumstances without supposing
 the personal essentiality of the man it is evident that a change of
 the chief magistrate at the breaking out of a war or at any
 similar crisis for another even of equal merit would at all times
 be detrimental to the community inasmuch as it would substitute
 inexperience to experience and would tend to unhinge and set afloat
 the already settled train of the administration
a fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be that it would
 operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the
 administration by necessitating a change of men in the first
 office of the nation it would necessitate a mutability of measures
 it is not generally to be expected that men will vary and measures
 remain uniform the contrary is the usual course of things and we
 need not be apprehensive that there will be too much stability
 while there is even the option of changing nor need we desire to
 prohibit the people from continuing their confidence where they
 think it may be safely placed and where by constancy on their
 part they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating
 councils and a variable policy
these are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the
 principle of exclusion they apply most forcibly to the scheme of a
 perpetual exclusion but when we consider that even a partial
 exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote
 and precarious object the observations which have been made will
 apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other
what are the advantages promised to counterbalance these
 disadvantages they are represented to be st greater
 independence in the magistrate d greater security to the people
 unless the exclusion be perpetual there will be no pretense to
 infer the first advantage but even in that case may he have no
 object beyond his present station to which he may sacrifice his
 independence may he have no connections no friends for whom he
 may sacrifice it may he not be less willing by a firm conduct to
 make personal enemies when he acts under the impression that a time
 is fast approaching on the arrival of which he not only may but
 must be exposed to their resentments upon an equal perhaps upon
 an inferior footing it is not an easy point to determine whether
 his independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an
 arrangement
as to the second supposed advantage there is still greater
 reason to entertain doubts concerning it if the exclusion were to
 be perpetual a man of irregular ambition of whom alone there could
 be reason in any case to entertain apprehension would with
 infinite reluctance yield to the necessity of taking his leave
 forever of a post in which his passion for power and preeminence
 had acquired the force of habit and if he had been fortunate or
 adroit enough to conciliate the goodwill of the people he might
 induce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint
 upon themselves a provision which was calculated to debar them of
 the right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite
 there may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the
 people seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite might
 occasion greater danger to liberty than could ever reasonably be
 dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office by the
 voluntary suffrages of the community exercising a constitutional
 privilege
there is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the
 people to continue in office men who had entitled themselves in
 their opinion to approbation and confidence the advantages of
 which are at best speculative and equivocal and are overbalanced by
 disadvantages far more certain and decisive

the provision for the support of the executive and the veto power
from the new york packet
friday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the
 executive authority is an adequate provision for its support it
 is evident that without proper attention to this article the
 separation of the executive from the legislative department would be
 merely nominal and nugatory the legislature with a discretionary
 power over the salary and emoluments of the chief magistrate could
 render him as obsequious to their will as they might think proper to
 make him they might in most cases either reduce him by famine
 or tempt him by largesses to surrender at discretion his judgment
 to their inclinations these expressions taken in all the latitude
 of the terms would no doubt convey more than is intended there
 are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of
 their duty but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils and
 in the main it will be found that a power over a mans support is a
 power over his will if it were necessary to confirm so plain a
 truth by facts examples would not be wanting even in this country
 of the intimidation or seduction of the executive by the terrors or
 allurements of the pecuniary arrangements of the legislative body
it is not easy therefore to commend too highly the judicious
 attention which has been paid to this subject in the proposed
 constitution it is there provided that the president of the
 united states shall at stated times receive for his services a
 compensation which shall neither be increased nor diminished during
 the period for which he shall have been elected and he shall not
 receive within that period any other emolument from the united
 states or any of them it is impossible to imagine any provision
 which would have been more eligible than this the legislature on
 the appointment of a president is once for all to declare what
 shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which
 he shall have been elected this done they will have no power to
 alter it either by increase or diminution till a new period of
 service by a new election commences they can neither weaken his
 fortitude by operating on his necessities nor corrupt his integrity
 by appealing to his avarice neither the union nor any of its
 members will be at liberty to give nor will he be at liberty to
 receive any other emolument than that which may have been
 determined by the first act he can of course have no pecuniary
 inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him
 by the constitution
the last of the requisites to energy which have been
 enumerated are competent powers let us proceed to consider those
 which are proposed to be vested in the president of the united
 states
the first thing that offers itself to our observation is the
 qualified negative of the president upon the acts or resolutions of
 the two houses of the legislature or in other words his power of
 returning all bills with objections to have the effect of
 preventing their becoming laws unless they should afterwards be
 ratified by two thirds of each of the component members of the
 legislative body
the propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the
 rights and to absorb the powers of the other departments has been
 already suggested and repeated the insufficiency of a mere
 parchment delineation of the boundaries of each has also been
 remarked upon and the necessity of furnishing each with
 constitutional arms for its own defense has been inferred and
 proved from these clear and indubitable principles results the
 propriety of a negative either absolute or qualified in the
 executive upon the acts of the legislative branches without the
 one or the other the former would be absolutely unable to defend
 himself against the depredations of the latter he might gradually
 be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions or
 annihilated by a single vote and in the one mode or the other the
 legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended
 in the same hands if even no propensity had ever discovered itself
 in the legislative body to invade the rights of the executive the
 rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves
 teach us that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the
 other but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of
 selfdefense
but the power in question has a further use it not only serves
 as a shield to the executive but it furnishes an additional
 security against the enaction of improper laws it establishes a
 salutary check upon the legislative body calculated to guard the
 community against the effects of faction precipitancy or of any
 impulse unfriendly to the public good which may happen to influence
 a majority of that body
the propriety of a negative has upon some occasions been
 combated by an observation that it was not to be presumed a single
 man would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men and
 that unless this presumption should be entertained it would be
 improper to give the executive magistrate any species of control
 over the legislative body
but this observation when examined will appear rather specious
 than solid the propriety of the thing does not turn upon the
 supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the executive but upon
 the supposition that the legislature will not be infallible that
 the love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to
 encroach upon the rights of other members of the government that a
 spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations that
 impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which
 itself on maturer reflexion would condemn the primary inducement
 to conferring the power in question upon the executive is to enable
 him to defend himself the secondary one is to increase the chances
 in favor of the community against the passing of bad laws through
 haste inadvertence or design the oftener the measure is brought
 under examination the greater the diversity in the situations of
 those who are to examine it the less must be the danger of those
