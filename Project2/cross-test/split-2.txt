the tendency of the principle of legislation for states or
 communities in their political capacities as it has been
 exemplified by the experiment we have made of it is equally
 attested by the events which have befallen all other governments of
 the confederate kind of which we have any account in exact
 proportion to its prevalence in those systems the confirmations of
 this fact will be worthy of a distinct and particular examination
 i shall content myself with barely observing here that of all the
 confederacies of antiquity which history has handed down to us the
 lycian and achaean leagues as far as there remain vestiges of them
 appear to have been most free from the fetters of that mistaken
 principle and were accordingly those which have best deserved and
 have most liberally received the applauding suffrages of political
 writers
this exceptionable principle may as truly as emphatically be
 styled the parent of anarchy it has been seen that delinquencies
 in the members of the union are its natural and necessary offspring
 and that whenever they happen the only constitutional remedy is
 force and the immediate effect of the use of it civil war
it remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government
 in its application to us would even be capable of answering its end 
 if there should not be a large army constantly at the disposal of
 the national government it would either not be able to employ force
 at all or when this could be done it would amount to a war
 between parts of the confederacy concerning the infractions of a
 league in which the strongest combination would be most likely to
 prevail whether it consisted of those who supported or of those who
 resisted the general authority it would rarely happen that the
 delinquency to be redressed would be confined to a single member
 and if there were more than one who had neglected their duty
 similarity of situation would induce them to unite for common
 defense independent of this motive of sympathy if a large and
 influential state should happen to be the aggressing member it
 would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win over
 some of them as associates to its cause specious arguments of
 danger to the common liberty could easily be contrived plausible
 excuses for the deficiencies of the party could without difficulty
 be invented to alarm the apprehensions inflame the passions and
 conciliate the goodwill even of those states which were not
 chargeable with any violation or omission of duty this would be
 the more likely to take place as the delinquencies of the larger
 members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious
 premeditation in their rulers with a view to getting rid of all
 external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement the
 better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand
 with leading individuals in the adjacent states if associates
 could not be found at home recourse would be had to the aid of
 foreign powers who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the
 dissensions of a confederacy from the firm union of which they had
 so much to fear when the sword is once drawn the passions of men
 observe no bounds of moderation the suggestions of wounded pride
 the instigations of irritated resentment would be apt to carry the
 states against which the arms of the union were exerted to any
 extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace of
 submission the first war of this kind would probably terminate in
 a dissolution of the union
this may be considered as the violent death of the confederacy
 its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of
 experiencing if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a
 more substantial form it is not probable considering the genius
 of this country that the complying states would often be inclined
 to support the authority of the union by engaging in a war against
 the noncomplying states they would always be more ready to pursue
 the milder course of putting themselves upon an equal footing with
 the delinquent members by an imitation of their example and the
 guilt of all would thus become the security of all our past
 experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in its full
 light there would in fact be an insuperable difficulty in
 ascertaining when force could with propriety be employed in the
 article of pecuniary contribution which would be the most usual
 source of delinquency it would often be impossible to decide
 whether it had proceeded from disinclination or inability the
 pretense of the latter would always be at hand and the case must
 be very flagrant in which its fallacy could be detected with
 sufficient certainty to justify the harsh expedient of compulsion
 it is easy to see that this problem alone as often as it should
 occur would open a wide field for the exercise of factious views
 of partiality and of oppression in the majority that happened to
 prevail in the national council
it seems to require no pains to prove that the states ought not
 to prefer a national constitution which could only be kept in motion
 by the instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to
 execute the ordinary requisitions or decrees of the government and
 yet this is the plain alternative involved by those who wish to deny
 it the power of extending its operations to individuals such a
 scheme if practicable at all would instantly degenerate into a
 military despotism but it will be found in every light
 impracticable the resources of the union would not be equal to the
 maintenance of an army considerable enough to confine the larger
 states within the limits of their duty nor would the means ever be
 furnished of forming such an army in the first instance whoever
 considers the populousness and strength of several of these states
 singly at the present juncture and looks forward to what they will
 become even at the distance of half a century will at once dismiss
 as idle and visionary any scheme which aims at regulating their
 movements by laws to operate upon them in their collective
 capacities and to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in
 the same capacities a project of this kind is little less romantic
 than the monstertaming spirit which is attributed to the fabulous
 heroes and demigods of antiquity
even in those confederacies which have been composed of members
 smaller than many of our counties the principle of legislation for
 sovereign states supported by military coercion has never been
 found effectual it has rarely been attempted to be employed but
 against the weaker members and in most instances attempts to
 coerce the refractory and disobedient have been the signals of
 bloody wars in which one half of the confederacy has displayed its
 banners against the other half
the result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be
 clearly this that if it be possible at any rate to construct a
 federal government capable of regulating the common concerns and
 preserving the general tranquillity it must be founded as to the
 objects committed to its care upon the reverse of the principle
 contended for by the opponents of the proposed constitution it
 must carry its agency to the persons of the citizens it must stand
 in need of no intermediate legislations but must itself be
 empowered to employ the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute
 its own resolutions the majesty of the national authority must be
 manifested through the medium of the courts of justice the
 government of the union like that of each state must be able to
 address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals
 and to attract to its support those passions which have the
 strongest influence upon the human heart it must in short
 possess all the means and have aright to resort to all the methods
 of executing the powers with which it is intrusted that are
 possessed and exercised by the government of the particular states
to this reasoning it may perhaps be objected that if any state
 should be disaffected to the authority of the union it could at any
 time obstruct the execution of its laws and bring the matter to the
 same issue of force with the necessity of which the opposite scheme
 is reproached
the pausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we
 advert to the essential difference between a mere noncompliance and
 a direct and active resistance if the interposition of the state
 legislatures be necessary to give effect to a measure of the union
 they have only not to act or to act evasively and the measure is
 defeated this neglect of duty may be disguised under affected but
 unsubstantial provisions so as not to appear and of course not to
 excite any alarm in the people for the safety of the constitution
 the state leaders may even make a merit of their surreptitious
 invasions of it on the ground of some temporary convenience
 exemption or advantage
but if the execution of the laws of the national government
 should not require the intervention of the state legislatures if
 they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens
 themselves the particular governments could not interrupt their
 progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional
 power no omissions nor evasions would answer the end they would
 be obliged to act and in such a manner as would leave no doubt that
 they had encroached on the national rights an experiment of this
 nature would always be hazardous in the face of a constitution in
 any degree competent to its own defense and of a people enlightened
 enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and an illegal
 usurpation of authority the success of it would require not merely
 a factious majority in the legislature but the concurrence of the
 courts of justice and of the body of the people if the judges were
 not embarked in a conspiracy with the legislature they would
 pronounce the resolutions of such a majority to be contrary to the
 supreme law of the land unconstitutional and void if the people
 were not tainted with the spirit of their state representatives
 they as the natural guardians of the constitution would throw
 their weight into the national scale and give it a decided
 preponderancy in the contest attempts of this kind would not often
 be made with levity or rashness because they could seldom be made
 without danger to the authors unless in cases of a tyrannical
 exercise of the federal authority
if opposition to the national government should arise from the
 disorderly conduct of refractory or seditious individuals it could
 be overcome by the same means which are daily employed against the
 same evil under the state governments the magistracy being
 equally the ministers of the law of the land from whatever source
 it might emanate would doubtless be as ready to guard the national
 as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiousness
 as to those partial commotions and insurrections which sometimes
 disquiet society from the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction
 or from sudden or occasional illhumors that do not infect the great
 body of the community the general government could command more
 extensive resources for the suppression of disturbances of that kind
 than would be in the power of any single member and as to those
 mortal feuds which in certain conjunctures spread a conflagration
 through a whole nation or through a very large proportion of it
 proceeding either from weighty causes of discontent given by the
 government or from the contagion of some violent popular paroxysm
 they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation when
 they happen they commonly amount to revolutions and dismemberments
 of empire no form of government can always either avoid or control
 them it is in vain to hope to guard against events too mighty for
 human foresight or precaution and it would be idle to object to a
 government because it could not perform impossibilities

for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
an objection of a nature different from that which has been
 stated and answered in my last address may perhaps be likewise
 urged against the principle of legislation for the individual
 citizens of america it may be said that it would tend to render
 the government of the union too powerful and to enable it to absorb
 those residuary authorities which it might be judged proper to
 leave with the states for local purposes allowing the utmost
 latitude to the love of power which any reasonable man can require
 i confess i am at a loss to discover what temptation the persons
 intrusted with the administration of the general government could
 ever feel to divest the states of the authorities of that
 description the regulation of the mere domestic police of a state
 appears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition
 commerce finance negotiation and war seem to comprehend all the
 objects which have charms for minds governed by that passion and
 all the powers necessary to those objects ought in the first
 instance to be lodged in the national depository the
 administration of private justice between the citizens of the same
 state the supervision of agriculture and of other concerns of a
 similar nature all those things in short which are proper to be
 provided for by local legislation can never be desirable cares of a
 general jurisdiction it is therefore improbable that there should
 exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp the powers with
 which they are connected because the attempt to exercise those
 powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory and the
 possession of them for that reason would contribute nothing to the
 dignity to the importance or to the splendor of the national
 government
but let it be admitted for arguments sake that mere
 wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget that
 disposition still it may be safely affirmed that the sense of the
 constituent body of the national representatives or in other
 words the people of the several states would control the
 indulgence of so extravagant an appetite it will always be far
 more easy for the state governments to encroach upon the national
 authorities than for the national government to encroach upon the
 state authorities the proof of this proposition turns upon the
 greater degree of influence which the state governments if they
 administer their affairs with uprightness and prudence will
 generally possess over the people a circumstance which at the same
 time teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in
 all federal constitutions and that too much pains cannot be taken
 in their organization to give them all the force which is
 compatible with the principles of liberty
the superiority of influence in favor of the particular
 governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of
 the national government but chiefly from the nature of the objects
 to which the attention of the state administrations would be
 directed
it is a known fact in human nature that its affections are
 commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the
 object upon the same principle that a man is more attached to his
 family than to his neighborhood to his neighborhood than to the
 community at large the people of each state would be apt to feel a
 stronger bias towards their local governments than towards the
 government of the union unless the force of that principle should
 be destroyed by a much better administration of the latter
this strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful
 auxiliaries in the objects of state regulation
the variety of more minute interests which will necessarily
 fall under the superintendence of the local administrations and
 which will form so many rivulets of influence running through every
 part of the society cannot be particularized without involving a
 detail too tedious and uninteresting to compensate for the
 instruction it might afford
there is one transcendant advantage belonging to the province of
 the state governments which alone suffices to place the matter in a
 clear and satisfactory lighti mean the ordinary administration of
 criminal and civil justice this of all others is the most
 powerful most universal and most attractive source of popular
 obedience and attachment it is that which being the immediate and
 visible guardian of life and property having its benefits and its
 terrors in constant activity before the public eye regulating all
 those personal interests and familiar concerns to which the
 sensibility of individuals is more immediately awake contributes
 more than any other circumstance to impressing upon the minds of
 the people affection esteem and reverence towards the government
 this great cement of society which will diffuse itself almost
 wholly through the channels of the particular governments
 independent of all other causes of influence would insure them so
 decided an empire over their respective citizens as to render them
 at all times a complete counterpoise and not unfrequently
 dangerous rivals to the power of the union
the operations of the national government on the other hand
 falling less immediately under the observation of the mass of the
 citizens the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and
 attended to by speculative men relating to more general interests
 they will be less apt to come home to the feelings of the people
 and in proportion less likely to inspire an habitual sense of
 obligation and an active sentiment of attachment
the reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by
 the experience of all federal constitutions with which we are
 acquainted and of all others which have borne the least analogy to
 them
though the ancient feudal systems were not strictly speaking
 confederacies yet they partook of the nature of that species of
 association there was a common head chieftain or sovereign
 whose authority extended over the whole nation and a number of
 subordinate vassals or feudatories who had large portions of land
 allotted to them and numerous trains of inferior vassals or
 retainers who occupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of
 fealty or obedience to the persons of whom they held it each
 principal vassal was a kind of sovereign within his particular
 demesnes the consequences of this situation were a continual
 opposition to authority of the sovereign and frequent wars between
 the great barons or chief feudatories themselves the power of the
 head of the nation was commonly too weak either to preserve the
 public peace or to protect the people against the oppressions of
 their immediate lords this period of european affairs is
 emphatically styled by historians the times of feudal anarchy
when the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike
 temper and of superior abilities he would acquire a personal weight
 and influence which answered for the time the purpose of a more
 regular authority but in general the power of the barons
 triumphed over that of the prince and in many instances his
 dominion was entirely thrown off and the great fiefs were erected
 into independent principalities or states in those instances in
 which the monarch finally prevailed over his vassals his success
 was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those vassals over their
 dependents the barons or nobles equally the enemies of the
 sovereign and the oppressors of the common people were dreaded and
 detested by both till mutual danger and mutual interest effected a
 union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy had the
 nobles by a conduct of clemency and justice preserved the fidelity
 and devotion of their retainers and followers the contests between
 them and the prince must almost always have ended in their favor
 and in the abridgment or subversion of the royal authority
this is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or
 conjecture among other illustrations of its truth which might be
 cited scotland will furnish a cogent example the spirit of
 clanship which was at an early day introduced into that kingdom
 uniting the nobles and their dependants by ties equivalent to those
 of kindred rendered the aristocracy a constant overmatch for the
 power of the monarch till the incorporation with england subdued
 its fierce and ungovernable spirit and reduced it within those
 rules of subordination which a more rational and more energetic
 system of civil polity had previously established in the latter
 kingdom
the separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared
 with the feudal baronies with this advantage in their favor that
 from the reasons already explained they will generally possess the
 confidence and goodwill of the people and with so important a
 support will be able effectually to oppose all encroachments of the
 national government it will be well if they are not able to
 counteract its legitimate and necessary authority the points of
 similitude consist in the rivalship of power applicable to both
 and in the concentration of large portions of the strength of the
 community into particular deposits in one case at the disposal of
 individuals in the other case at the disposal of political bodies
a concise review of the events that have attended confederate
 governments will further illustrate this important doctrine an
 inattention to which has been the great source of our political
 mistakes and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side
 this review shall form the subject of some ensuing papers

the insufficiency of the present confederation to preserve the

for the independent journal
hamilton and madison
to the people of the state of new york
among the confederacies of antiquity the most considerable was
 that of the grecian republics associated under the amphictyonic
 council from the best accounts transmitted of this celebrated
 institution it bore a very instructive analogy to the present
 confederation of the american states
the members retained the character of independent and sovereign
 states and had equal votes in the federal council this council
 had a general authority to propose and resolve whatever it judged
 necessary for the common welfare of greece to declare and carry on
 war to decide in the last resort all controversies between the
 members to fine the aggressing party to employ the whole force
 of the confederacy against the disobedient to admit new members
 the amphictyons were the guardians of religion and of the immense
 riches belonging to the temple of delphos where they had the right
 of jurisdiction in controversies between the inhabitants and those
 who came to consult the oracle as a further provision for the
 efficacy of the federal powers they took an oath mutually to defend
 and protect the united cities to punish the violators of this oath
 and to inflict vengeance on sacrilegious despoilers of the temple
in theory and upon paper this apparatus of powers seems amply
 sufficient for all general purposes in several material instances
 they exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation
 the amphictyons had in their hands the superstition of the times
 one of the principal engines by which government was then
 maintained they had a declared authority to use coercion against
 refractory cities and were bound by oath to exert this authority on
 the necessary occasions
very different nevertheless was the experiment from the theory 
 the powers like those of the present congress were administered
 by deputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political
 capacities and exercised over them in the same capacities hence
 the weakness the disorders and finally the destruction of the
 confederacy the more powerful members instead of being kept in
 awe and subordination tyrannized successively over all the rest
 athens as we learn from demosthenes was the arbiter of greece
 seventythree years the lacedaemonians next governed it
 twentynine years at a subsequent period after the battle of
 leuctra the thebans had their turn of domination
it happened but too often according to plutarch that the
 deputies of the strongest cities awed and corrupted those of the
 weaker and that judgment went in favor of the most powerful party
even in the midst of defensive and dangerous wars with persia
 and macedon the members never acted in concert and were more or
 fewer of them eternally the dupes or the hirelings of the common
 enemy the intervals of foreign war were filled up by domestic
 vicissitudes convulsions and carnage
after the conclusion of the war with xerxes it appears that the
 lacedaemonians required that a number of the cities should be turned
 out of the confederacy for the unfaithful part they had acted the
 athenians finding that the lacedaemonians would lose fewer
 partisans by such a measure than themselves and would become
 masters of the public deliberations vigorously opposed and defeated
 the attempt this piece of history proves at once the inefficiency
 of the union the ambition and jealousy of its most powerful
 members and the dependent and degraded condition of the rest the
 smaller members though entitled by the theory of their system to
 revolve in equal pride and majesty around the common center had
 become in fact satellites of the orbs of primary magnitude
had the greeks says the abbe milot been as wise as they were
 courageous they would have been admonished by experience of the
 necessity of a closer union and would have availed themselves of
 the peace which followed their success against the persian arms to
 establish such a reformation instead of this obvious policy
 athens and sparta inflated with the victories and the glory they
 had acquired became first rivals and then enemies and did each
 other infinitely more mischief than they had suffered from xerxes
 their mutual jealousies fears hatreds and injuries ended in the
 celebrated peloponnesian war which itself ended in the ruin and
 slavery of the athenians who had begun it
as a weak government when not at war is ever agitated by
 internal dissentions so these never fail to bring on fresh
 calamities from abroad the phocians having ploughed up some
 consecrated ground belonging to the temple of apollo the
 amphictyonic council according to the superstition of the age
 imposed a fine on the sacrilegious offenders the phocians being
 abetted by athens and sparta refused to submit to the decree the
 thebans with others of the cities undertook to maintain the
 authority of the amphictyons and to avenge the violated god the
 latter being the weaker party invited the assistance of philip of
 macedon who had secretly fostered the contest philip gladly
 seized the opportunity of executing the designs he had long planned
 against the liberties of greece by his intrigues and bribes he won
 over to his interests the popular leaders of several cities by
 their influence and votes gained admission into the amphictyonic
 council and by his arts and his arms made himself master of the
 confederacy
such were the consequences of the fallacious principle on which
 this interesting establishment was founded had greece says a
 judicious observer on her fate been united by a stricter
 confederation and persevered in her union she would never have
 worn the chains of macedon and might have proved a barrier to the
 vast projects of rome
the achaean league as it is called was another society of
 grecian republics which supplies us with valuable instruction
the union here was far more intimate and its organization much
 wiser than in the preceding instance it will accordingly appear
 that though not exempt from a similar catastrophe it by no means
 equally deserved it
the cities composing this league retained their municipal
 jurisdiction appointed their own officers and enjoyed a perfect
 equality the senate in which they were represented had the sole
 and exclusive right of peace and war of sending and receiving
 ambassadors of entering into treaties and alliances of
 appointing a chief magistrate or praetor as he was called who
 commanded their armies and who with the advice and consent of ten
 of the senators not only administered the government in the recess
 of the senate but had a great share in its deliberations when
 assembled according to the primitive constitution there were two
 praetors associated in the administration but on trial a single
 one was preferred
it appears that the cities had all the same laws and customs
 the same weights and measures and the same money but how far this
 effect proceeded from the authority of the federal council is left
 in uncertainty it is said only that the cities were in a manner
 compelled to receive the same laws and usages when lacedaemon was
 brought into the league by philopoemen it was attended with an
 abolition of the institutions and laws of lycurgus and an adoption
 of those of the achaeans the amphictyonic confederacy of which
 she had been a member left her in the full exercise of her
 government and her legislation this circumstance alone proves a
 very material difference in the genius of the two systems
it is much to be regretted that such imperfect monuments remain
 of this curious political fabric could its interior structure and
 regular operation be ascertained it is probable that more light
 would be thrown by it on the science of federal government than by
 any of the like experiments with which we are acquainted
one important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians
 who take notice of achaean affairs it is that as well after the
 renovation of the league by aratus as before its dissolution by the
 arts of macedon there was infinitely more of moderation and justice
 in the administration of its government and less of violence and
 sedition in the people than were to be found in any of the cities
 exercising singly all the prerogatives of sovereignty the abbe
 mably in his observations on greece says that the popular
 government which was so tempestuous elsewhere caused no disorders
 in the members of the achaean republic because it was there
 tempered by the general authority and laws of the confederacy
we are not to conclude too hastily however that faction did
 not in a certain degree agitate the particular cities much less
 that a due subordination and harmony reigned in the general system
 the contrary is sufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate
 of the republic
whilst the amphictyonic confederacy remained that of the
 achaeans which comprehended the less important cities only made
 little figure on the theatre of greece when the former became a
 victim to macedon the latter was spared by the policy of philip and
 alexander under the successors of these princes however a
 different policy prevailed the arts of division were practiced
 among the achaeans each city was seduced into a separate interest
 the union was dissolved some of the cities fell under the tyranny
 of macedonian garrisons others under that of usurpers springing
 out of their own confusions shame and oppression erelong awaken
 their love of liberty a few cities reunited their example was
 followed by others as opportunities were found of cutting off their
 tyrants the league soon embraced almost the whole peloponnesus
 macedon saw its progress but was hindered by internal dissensions
 from stopping it all greece caught the enthusiasm and seemed ready
 to unite in one confederacy when the jealousy and envy in sparta
 and athens of the rising glory of the achaeans threw a fatal damp
 on the enterprise the dread of the macedonian power induced the
 league to court the alliance of the kings of egypt and syria who
 as successors of alexander were rivals of the king of macedon
 this policy was defeated by cleomenes king of sparta who was led
 by his ambition to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbors the
 achaeans and who as an enemy to macedon had interest enough with
 the egyptian and syrian princes to effect a breach of their
 engagements with the league
the achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of submitting to
 cleomenes or of supplicating the aid of macedon its former
 oppressor the latter expedient was adopted the contests of the
 greeks always afforded a pleasing opportunity to that powerful
 neighbor of intermeddling in their affairs a macedonian army
 quickly appeared cleomenes was vanquished the achaeans soon
 experienced as often happens that a victorious and powerful ally
 is but another name for a master all that their most abject
 compliances could obtain from him was a toleration of the exercise
 of their laws philip who was now on the throne of macedon soon
 provoked by his tyrannies fresh combinations among the greeks the
 achaeans though weakenened by internal dissensions and by the
 revolt of messene one of its members being joined by the aetolians
 and athenians erected the standard of opposition finding
 themselves though thus supported unequal to the undertaking they
 once more had recourse to the dangerous expedient of introducing the
 succor of foreign arms the romans to whom the invitation was
 made eagerly embraced it philip was conquered macedon subdued
 a new crisis ensued to the league dissensions broke out among it
 members these the romans fostered callicrates and other popular
 leaders became mercenary instruments for inveigling their countrymen 
 the more effectually to nourish discord and disorder the romans
 had to the astonishment of those who confided in their sincerity
 already proclaimed universal liberty throughout greece with
 the same insidious views they now seduced the members from the
 league by representing to their pride the violation it committed on
 their sovereignty by these arts this union the last hope of
 greece the last hope of ancient liberty was torn into pieces and
 such imbecility and distraction introduced that the arms of rome
 found little difficulty in completing the ruin which their arts had
 commenced the achaeans were cut to pieces and achaia loaded with
 chains under which it is groaning at this hour
i have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this
 important portion of history both because it teaches more than one
 lesson and because as a supplement to the outlines of the achaean
 constitution it emphatically illustrates the tendency of federal
 bodies rather to anarchy among the members than to tyranny in the
 head

to the people of the state of new york
the examples of ancient confederacies cited in my last paper
 have not exhausted the source of experimental instruction on this
 subject there are existing institutions founded on a similar
 principle which merit particular consideration the first which
 presents itself is the germanic body
in the early ages of christianity germany was occupied by seven
 distinct nations who had no common chief the franks one of the
 number having conquered the gauls established the kingdom which
 has taken its name from them in the ninth century charlemagne its
 warlike monarch carried his victorious arms in every direction
 and germany became a part of his vast dominions on the
 dismemberment which took place under his sons this part was
 erected into a separate and independent empire charlemagne and his
 immediate descendants possessed the reality as well as the ensigns
 and dignity of imperial power but the principal vassals whose
 fiefs had become hereditary and who composed the national diets
 which charlemagne had not abolished gradually threw off the yoke
 and advanced to sovereign jurisdiction and independence the force
 of imperial sovereignty was insufficient to restrain such powerful
 dependants or to preserve the unity and tranquillity of the empire 
 the most furious private wars accompanied with every species of
 calamity were carried on between the different princes and states
 the imperial authority unable to maintain the public order
 declined by degrees till it was almost extinct in the anarchy which
 agitated the long interval between the death of the last emperor of
 the suabian and the accession of the first emperor of the austrian
 lines in the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full
 sovereignty in the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols
 and decorations of power
out of this feudal system which has itself many of the
 important features of a confederacy has grown the federal system
 which constitutes the germanic empire its powers are vested in a
 diet representing the component members of the confederacy in the
 emperor who is the executive magistrate with a negative on the
 decrees of the diet and in the imperial chamber and the aulic
 council two judiciary tribunals having supreme jurisdiction in
 controversies which concern the empire or which happen among its
 members
the diet possesses the general power of legislating for the
 empire of making war and peace contracting alliances assessing
 quotas of troops and money constructing fortresses regulating
 coin admitting new members and subjecting disobedient members to
 the ban of the empire by which the party is degraded from his
 sovereign rights and his possessions forfeited the members of the
 confederacy are expressly restricted from entering into compacts
 prejudicial to the empire from imposing tolls and duties on their
 mutual intercourse without the consent of the emperor and diet
 from altering the value of money from doing injustice to one
 another or from affording assistance or retreat to disturbers of
 the public peace and the ban is denounced against such as shall
 violate any of these restrictions the members of the diet as
 such are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and diet
 and in their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial
 chamber
the prerogatives of the emperor are numerous the most
 important of them are his exclusive right to make propositions to
 the diet to negative its resolutions to name ambassadors to
 confer dignities and titles to fill vacant electorates to found
 universities to grant privileges not injurious to the states of
 the empire to receive and apply the public revenues and
 generally to watch over the public safety in certain cases the
 electors form a council to him in quality of emperor he possesses
 no territory within the empire nor receives any revenue for his
 support but his revenue and dominions in other qualities
 constitute him one of the most powerful princes in europe
from such a parade of constitutional powers in the
 representatives and head of this confederacy the natural
 supposition would be that it must form an exception to the general
 character which belongs to its kindred systems nothing would be
 further from the reality the fundamental principle on which it
 rests that the empire is a community of sovereigns that the diet
 is a representation of sovereigns and that the laws are addressed to
 sovereigns renders the empire a nerveless body incapable of
 regulating its own members insecure against external dangers and
 agitated with unceasing fermentations in its own bowels
the history of germany is a history of wars between the emperor
 and the princes and states of wars among the princes and states
 themselves of the licentiousness of the strong and the oppression
 of the weak of foreign intrusions and foreign intrigues of
 requisitions of men and money disregarded or partially complied
 with of attempts to enforce them altogether abortive or attended
 with slaughter and desolation involving the innocent with the
 guilty of general inbecility confusion and misery
in the sixteenth century the emperor with one part of the
 empire on his side was seen engaged against the other princes and
 states in one of the conflicts the emperor himself was put to
 flight and very near being made prisoner by the elector of saxony
 the late king of prussia was more than once pitted against his
 imperial sovereign and commonly proved an overmatch for him
 controversies and wars among the members themselves have been so
 common that the german annals are crowded with the bloody pages
 which describe them previous to the peace of westphalia germany
 was desolated by a war of thirty years in which the emperor with
 one half of the empire was on one side and sweden with the other
 half on the opposite side peace was at length negotiated and
 dictated by foreign powers and the articles of it to which
 foreign powers are parties made a fundamental part of the germanic
 constitution
if the nation happens on any emergency to be more united by
 the necessity of selfdefense its situation is still deplorable
 military preparations must be preceded by so many tedious
 discussions arising from the jealousies pride separate views and
 clashing pretensions of sovereign bodies that before the diet can
 settle the arrangements the enemy are in the field and before the
 federal troops are ready to take it are retiring into winter
 quarters
the small body of national troops which has been judged
 necessary in time of peace is defectively kept up badly paid
 infected with local prejudices and supported by irregular and
 disproportionate contributions to the treasury
the impossibility of maintaining order and dispensing justice
 among these sovereign subjects produced the experiment of dividing
 the empire into nine or ten circles or districts of giving them an
 interior organization and of charging them with the military
 execution of the laws against delinquent and contumacious members
 this experiment has only served to demonstrate more fully the
 radical vice of the constitution each circle is the miniature
 picture of the deformities of this political monster they either
 fail to execute their commissions or they do it with all the
 devastation and carnage of civil war sometimes whole circles are
 defaulters and then they increase the mischief which they were
 instituted to remedy
we may form some judgment of this scheme of military coercion
 from a sample given by thuanus in donawerth a free and imperial
 city of the circle of suabia the abb  de st croix enjoyed
 certain immunities which had been reserved to him in the exercise
 of these on some public occasions outrages were committed on him
 by the people of the city the consequence was that the city was
 put under the ban of the empire and the duke of bavaria though
 director of another circle obtained an appointment to enforce it
 he soon appeared before the city with a corps of ten thousand
 troops and finding it a fit occasion as he had secretly intended
 from the beginning to revive an antiquated claim on the pretext
 that his ancestors had suffered the place to be dismembered from his
 territory he took possession of it in his own name disarmed
 and punished the inhabitants and reannexed the city to his domains
it may be asked perhaps what has so long kept this disjointed
 machine from falling entirely to pieces the answer is obvious
 the weakness of most of the members who are unwilling to expose
 themselves to the mercy of foreign powers the weakness of most of
 the principal members compared with the formidable powers all
 around them the vast weight and influence which the emperor
 derives from his separate and heriditary dominions and the
 interest he feels in preserving a system with which his family pride
 is connected and which constitutes him the first prince in europe
 these causes support a feeble and precarious union whilst the
 repellant quality incident to the nature of sovereignty and which
 time continually strengthens prevents any reform whatever founded
 on a proper consolidation nor is it to be imagined if this
 obstacle could be surmounted that the neighboring powers would
 suffer a revolution to take place which would give to the empire the
 force and preeminence to which it is entitled foreign nations have
 long considered themselves as interested in the changes made by
 events in this constitution and have on various occasions
 betrayed their policy of perpetuating its anarchy and weakness
if more direct examples were wanting poland as a government
 over local sovereigns might not improperly be taken notice of nor
 could any proof more striking be given of the calamities flowing
 from such institutions equally unfit for selfgovernment and
 selfdefense it has long been at the mercy of its powerful
 neighbors who have lately had the mercy to disburden it of one
 third of its people and territories
the connection among the swiss cantons scarcely amounts to a
 confederacy though it is sometimes cited as an instance of the
 stability of such institutions
they have no common treasury no common troops even in war no
 common coin no common judicatory nor any other common mark of
 sovereignty
they are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical
 position by their individual weakness and insignificancy by the
 fear of powerful neighbors to one of which they were formerly
 subject by the few sources of contention among a people of such
 simple and homogeneous manners by their joint interest in their
 dependent possessions by the mutual aid they stand in need of for
 suppressing insurrections and rebellions an aid expressly
 stipulated and often required and afforded and by the necessity of
 some regular and permanent provision for accomodating disputes among
 the cantons the provision is that the parties at variance shall
 each choose four judges out of the neutral cantons who in case of
 disagreement choose an umpire this tribunal under an oath of
 impartiality pronounces definitive sentence which all the cantons
 are bound to enforce the competency of this regulation may be
 estimated by a clause in their treaty of  with victor amadeus
 of savoy in which he obliges himself to interpose as mediator in
 disputes between the cantons and to employ force if necessary
 against the contumacious party
so far as the peculiarity of their case will admit of comparison
 with that of the united states it serves to confirm the principle
 intended to be established whatever efficacy the union may have
 had in ordinary cases it appears that the moment a cause of
 difference sprang up capable of trying its strength it failed
 the controversies on the subject of religion which in three
 instances have kindled violent and bloody contests may be said in
 fact to have severed the league the protestant and catholic
 cantons have since had their separate diets where all the most
 important concerns are adjusted and which have left the general
 diet little other business than to take care of the common bailages
that separation had another consequence which merits attention
 it produced opposite alliances with foreign powers of berne at
 the head of the protestant association with the united provinces
 and of luzerne at the head of the catholic association with
 france

the insufficiency fo the present confederation to preserve the
 union
from the new york packet
tuesday december  
hamilton and madison
to the people of the state of new york
the united netherlands are a confederacy of republics or rather
 of aristocracies of a very remarkable texture yet confirming all
 the lessons derived from those which we have already reviewed
the union is composed of seven coequal and sovereign states and
 each state or province is a composition of equal and independent
 cities in all important cases not only the provinces but the
 cities must be unanimous
the sovereignty of the union is represented by the
 statesgeneral consisting usually of about fifty deputies appointed
 by the provinces they hold their seats some for life some for
 six three and one years from two provinces they continue in
 appointment during pleasure
the statesgeneral have authority to enter into treaties and
 alliances to make war and peace to raise armies and equip
 fleets to ascertain quotas and demand contributions in all these
 cases however unanimity and the sanction of their constituents are
 requisite they have authority to appoint and receive ambassadors
 to execute treaties and alliances already formed to provide for
 the collection of duties on imports and exports to regulate the
 mint with a saving to the provincial rights to govern as
 sovereigns the dependent territories the provinces are restrained
 unless with the general consent from entering into foreign
 treaties from establishing imposts injurious to others or
 charging their neighbors with higher duties than their own subjects
 a council of state a chamber of accounts with five colleges of
 admiralty aid and fortify the federal administration
the executive magistrate of the union is the stadtholder who is
 now an hereditary prince his principal weight and influence in the
 republic are derived from this independent title from his great
 patrimonial estates from his family connections with some of the
 chief potentates of europe and more than all perhaps from his
 being stadtholder in the several provinces as well as for the
 union in which provincial quality he has the appointment of town
 magistrates under certain regulations executes provincial decrees
 presides when he pleases in the provincial tribunals and has
 throughout the power of pardon
as stadtholder of the union he has however considerable
 prerogatives
in his political capacity he has authority to settle disputes
 between the provinces when other methods fail to assist at the
 deliberations of the statesgeneral and at their particular
 conferences to give audiences to foreign ambassadors and to keep
 agents for his particular affairs at foreign courts
in his military capacity he commands the federal troops
 provides for garrisons and in general regulates military affairs
 disposes of all appointments from colonels to ensigns and of the
 governments and posts of fortified towns
in his marine capacity he is admiralgeneral and superintends
 and directs every thing relative to naval forces and other naval
 affairs presides in the admiralties in person or by proxy
 appoints lieutenantadmirals and other officers and establishes
 councils of war whose sentences are not executed till he approves
 them
his revenue exclusive of his private income amounts to three
 hundred thousand florins the standing army which he commands
 consists of about forty thousand men
such is the nature of the celebrated belgic confederacy as
 delineated on parchment what are the characters which practice has
 stamped upon it imbecility in the government discord among the
 provinces foreign influence and indignities a precarious
 existence in peace and peculiar calamities from war
it was long ago remarked by grotius that nothing but the hatred
 of his countrymen to the house of austria kept them from being
 ruined by the vices of their constitution
the union of utrecht says another respectable writer reposes
 an authority in the statesgeneral seemingly sufficient to secure
 harmony but the jealousy in each province renders the practice very
 different from the theory
the same instrument says another obliges each province to levy
 certain contributions but this article never could and probably
 never will be executed because the inland provinces who have
 little commerce cannot pay an equal quota
in matters of contribution it is the practice to waive the
 articles of the constitution the danger of delay obliges the
 consenting provinces to furnish their quotas without waiting for
 the others and then to obtain reimbursement from the others by
 deputations which are frequent or otherwise as they can the
 great wealth and influence of the province of holland enable her to
 effect both these purposes
it has more than once happened that the deficiencies had to be
 ultimately collected at the point of the bayonet a thing
 practicable though dreadful in a confedracy where one of the
 members exceeds in force all the rest and where several of them are
 too small to meditate resistance but utterly impracticable in one
 composed of members several of which are equal to each other in
 strength and resources and equal singly to a vigorous and
 persevering defense
foreign ministers says sir william temple who was himself a
 foreign minister elude matters taken ad referendum by
 tampering with the provinces and cities in  the treaty of
 hanover was delayed by these means a whole year instances of a
 like nature are numerous and notorious
in critical emergencies the statesgeneral are often compelled
 to overleap their constitutional bounds in  they concluded a
 treaty of themselves at the risk of their heads the treaty of
 westphalia in  by which their independence was formerly and
 finally recognized was concluded without the consent of zealand
 even as recently as the last treaty of peace with great britain
 the constitutional principle of unanimity was departed from a weak
 constitution must necessarily terminate in dissolution for want of
 proper powers or the usurpation of powers requisite for the public
 safety whether the usurpation when once begun will stop at the
 salutary point or go forward to the dangerous extreme must depend
 on the contingencies of the moment tyranny has perhaps oftener
 grown out of the assumptions of power called for on pressing
 exigencies by a defective constitution than out of the full
 exercise of the largest constitutional authorities
notwithstanding the calamities produced by the stadtholdership
 it has been supposed that without his influence in the individual
 provinces the causes of anarchy manifest in the confederacy would
 long ago have dissolved it under such a government says the
 abbe mably the union could never have subsisted if the provinces
 had not a spring within themselves capable of quickening their
 tardiness and compelling them to the same way of thinking this
 spring is the stadtholder it is remarked by sir william temple
 that in the intermissions of the stadtholdership holland by her
 riches and her authority which drew the others into a sort of
 dependence supplied the place
these are not the only circumstances which have controlled the
 tendency to anarchy and dissolution the surrounding powers impose
 an absolute necessity of union to a certain degree at the same time
 that they nourish by their intrigues the constitutional vices which
 keep the republic in some degree always at their mercy
the true patriots have long bewailed the fatal tendency of these
 vices and have made no less than four regular experiments by
 extraordinary assemblies convened for the special purpose to apply
 a remedy as many times has their laudable zeal found it impossible
 to unite the public councils in reforming the known the
 acknowledged the fatal evils of the existing constitution let us
 pause my fellowcitizens for one moment over this melancholy and
 monitory lesson of history and with the tear that drops for the
 calamities brought on mankind by their adverse opinions and selfish
 passions let our gratitude mingle an ejaculation to heaven for the
 propitious concord which has distinguished the consultations for our
 political happiness
a design was also conceived of establishing a general tax to be
 administered by the federal authority this also had its
 adversaries and failed
this unhappy people seem to be now suffering from popular
 convulsions from dissensions among the states and from the actual
 invasion of foreign arms the crisis of their distiny all nations
 have their eyes fixed on the awful spectacle the first wish
 prompted by humanity is that this severe trial may issue in such a
 revolution of their government as will establish their union and
 render it the parent of tranquillity freedom and happiness the
 next that the asylum under which we trust the enjoyment of these
 blessings will speedily be secured in this country may receive and
 console them for the catastrophe of their own
i make no apology for having dwelt so long on the contemplation
 of these federal precedents experience is the oracle of truth
 and where its responses are unequivocal they ought to be
 conclusive and sacred the important truth which it unequivocally
 pronounces in the present case is that a sovereignty over
 sovereigns a government over governments a legislation for
 communities as contradistinguished from individuals as it is a
 solecism in theory so in practice it is subversive of the order and
 ends of civil polity by substituting violence in place of law or
 the destructive coercion of the sword in place of the mild and
 salutary coercion of the magistracy

other defects of the present confederation
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
having in the three last numbers taken a summary review of the
 principal circumstances and events which have depicted the genius
 and fate of other confederate governments i shall now proceed in
 the enumeration of the most important of those defects which have
 hitherto disappointed our hopes from the system established among
 ourselves to form a safe and satisfactory judgment of the proper
 remedy it is absolutely necessary that we should be well acquainted
 with the extent and malignity of the disease
the next most palpable defect of the subsisting confederation
 is the total want of a sanction to its laws the united states as
 now composed have no powers to exact obedience or punish
 disobedience to their resolutions either by pecuniary mulcts by a
 suspension or divestiture of privileges or by any other
 constitutional mode there is no express delegation of authority to
 them to use force against delinquent members and if such a right
 should be ascribed to the federal head as resulting from the nature
 of the social compact between the states it must be by inference
 and construction in the face of that part of the second article by
 which it is declared that each state shall retain every power
 jurisdiction and right not expressly delegated to the united
 states in congress assembled there is doubtless a striking
 absurdity in supposing that a right of this kind does not exist but
 we are reduced to the dilemma either of embracing that supposition
 preposterous as it may seem or of contravening or explaining away a
 provision which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies
 of those who oppose the new constitution and the want of which in
 that plan has been the subject of much plausible animadversion and
 severe criticism if we are unwilling to impair the force of this
 applauded provision we shall be obliged to conclude that the
 united states afford the extraordinary spectacle of a government
 destitute even of the shadow of constitutional power to enforce the
 execution of its own laws it will appear from the specimens which
 have been cited that the american confederacy in this particular
 stands discriminated from every other institution of a similar kind
 and exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world
the want of a mutual guaranty of the state governments is
 another capital imperfection in the federal plan there is nothing
 of this kind declared in the articles that compose it and to imply
 a tacit guaranty from considerations of utility would be a still
 more flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned
 than to imply a tacit power of coercion from the like considerations
 the want of a guaranty though it might in its consequences
 endanger the union does not so immediately attack its existence as
 the want of a constitutional sanction to its laws
without a guaranty the assistance to be derived from the union
 in repelling those domestic dangers which may sometimes threaten the
 existence of the state constitutions must be renounced usurpation
 may rear its crest in each state and trample upon the liberties of
 the people while the national government could legally do nothing
 more than behold its encroachments with indignation and regret a
 successful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and
 law while no succor could constitutionally be afforded by the union
 to the friends and supporters of the government the tempestuous
 situation from which massachusetts has scarcely emerged evinces
 that dangers of this kind are not merely speculative who can
 determine what might have been the issue of her late convulsions if
 the malcontents had been headed by a caesar or by a cromwell who
 can predict what effect a despotism established in massachusetts
 would have upon the liberties of new hampshire or rhode island of
 connecticut or new york
the inordinate pride of state importance has suggested to some
 minds an objection to the principle of a guaranty in the federal
 government as involving an officious interference in the domestic
 concerns of the members a scruple of this kind would deprive us of
 one of the principal advantages to be expected from union and can
 only flow from a misapprehension of the nature of the provision
 itself it could be no impediment to reforms of the state
 constitution by a majority of the people in a legal and peaceable
 mode this right would remain undiminished the guaranty could
 only operate against changes to be effected by violence towards
 the preventions of calamities of this kind too many checks cannot
 be provided the peace of society and the stability of government
 depend absolutely on the efficacy of the precautions adopted on this
 head where the whole power of the government is in the hands of
 the people there is the less pretense for the use of violent
 remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the state the
 natural cure for an illadministration in a popular or
 representative constitution is a change of men a guaranty by the
 national authority would be as much levelled against the usurpations
 of rulers as against the ferments and outrages of faction and
 sedition in the community
the principle of regulating the contributions of the states to
 the common treasury by quotas is another fundamental error in the
 confederation its repugnancy to an adequate supply of the national
 exigencies has been already pointed out and has sufficiently
 appeared from the trial which has been made of it i speak of it
 now solely with a view to equality among the states those who have
 been accustomed to contemplate the circumstances which produce and
 constitute national wealth must be satisfied that there is no
 common standard or barometer by which the degrees of it can be
 ascertained neither the value of lands nor the numbers of the
 people which have been successively proposed as the rule of state
 contributions has any pretension to being a just representative
 if we compare the wealth of the united netherlands with that of
 russia or germany or even of france and if we at the same time
 compare the total value of the lands and the aggregate population of
 that contracted district with the total value of the lands and the
 aggregate population of the immense regions of either of the three
 lastmentioned countries we shall at once discover that there is no
 comparison between the proportion of either of these two objects and
 that of the relative wealth of those nations if the like parallel
 were to be run between several of the american states it would
 furnish a like result let virginia be contrasted with north
 carolina pennsylvania with connecticut or maryland with new
 jersey and we shall be convinced that the respective abilities of
 those states in relation to revenue bear little or no analogy to
 their comparative stock in lands or to their comparative population
 the position may be equally illustrated by a similar process
 between the counties of the same state no man who is acquainted
 with the state of new york will doubt that the active wealth of
 kings county bears a much greater proportion to that of montgomery
 than it would appear to be if we should take either the total value
 of the lands or the total number of the people as a criterion
the wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of causes
 situation soil climate the nature of the productions the
 nature of the government the genius of the citizens the degree of
 information they possess the state of commerce of arts of
 industry these circumstances and many more too complex minute or
 adventitious to admit of a particular specification occasion
 differences hardly conceivable in the relative opulence and riches
 of different countries the consequence clearly is that there can
 be no common measure of national wealth and of course no general
 or stationary rule by which the ability of a state to pay taxes can
 be determined the attempt therefore to regulate the
 contributions of the members of a confederacy by any such rule
 cannot fail to be productive of glaring inequality and extreme
 oppression
this inequality would of itself be sufficient in america to work
 the eventual destruction of the union if any mode of enforcing a
 compliance with its requisitions could be devised the suffering
 states would not long consent to remain associated upon a principle
 which distributes the public burdens with so unequal a hand and
 which was calculated to impoverish and oppress the citizens of some
 states while those of others would scarcely be conscious of the
 small proportion of the weight they were required to sustain this
 however is an evil inseparable from the principle of quotas and
 requisitions
there is no method of steering clear of this inconvenience but
 by authorizing the national government to raise its own revenues in
 its own way imposts excises and in general all duties upon
 articles of consumption may be compared to a fluid which will in
 time find its level with the means of paying them the amount to
 be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own
 option and can be regulated by an attention to his resources the
 rich may be extravagant the poor can be frugal and private
 oppression may always be avoided by a judicious selection of objects
 proper for such impositions if inequalities should arise in some
 states from duties on particular objects these will in all
 probability be counterbalanced by proportional inequalities in
 other states from the duties on other objects in the course of
 time and things an equilibrium as far as it is attainable in so
 complicated a subject will be established everywhere or if
 inequalities should still exist they would neither be so great in
 their degree so uniform in their operation nor so odious in their
 appearance as those which would necessarily spring from quotas
 upon any scale that can possibly be devised
it is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption
 that they contain in their own nature a security against excess
 they prescribe their own limit which cannot be exceeded without
 defeating the end proposed that is an extension of the revenue
 when applied to this object the saying is as just as it is witty
 that in political arithmetic two and two do not always make four
 if duties are too high they lessen the consumption the
 collection is eluded and the product to the treasury is not so
 great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds
 this forms a complete barrier against any material oppression of
 the citizens by taxes of this class and is itself a natural
 limitation of the power of imposing them
impositions of this kind usually fall under the denomination of
 indirect taxes and must for a long time constitute the chief part
 of the revenue raised in this country those of the direct kind
 which principally relate to land and buildings may admit of a rule
 of apportionment either the value of land or the number of the
 people may serve as a standard the state of agriculture and the
 populousness of a country have been considered as nearly connected
 with each other and as a rule for the purpose intended numbers
 in the view of simplicity and certainty are entitled to a
 preference in every country it is a herculean task to obtain a
 valuation of the land in a country imperfectly settled and
 progressive in improvement the difficulties are increased almost to
 impracticability the expense of an accurate valuation is in all
 situations a formidable objection in a branch of taxation where
 no limits to the discretion of the government are to be found in the
 nature of things the establishment of a fixed rule not
 incompatible with the end may be attended with fewer inconveniences
 than to leave that discretion altogether at large

other defects of the present confederation
from the new york packet
friday december  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
in addition to the defects already enumerated in the existing
 federal system there are others of not less importance which
 concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the administration of
 the affairs of the union
the want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties
 allowed to be of the number the utility of such a power has been
 anticipated under the first head of our inquiries and for this
 reason as well as from the universal conviction entertained upon
 the subject little need be added in this place it is indeed
 evident on the most superficial view that there is no object
 either as it respects the interests of trade or finance that more
 strongly demands a federal superintendence the want of it has
 already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties
 with foreign powers and has given occasions of dissatisfaction
 between the states no nation acquainted with the nature of our
 political association would be unwise enough to enter into
 stipulations with the united states by which they conceded
 privileges of any importance to them while they were apprised that
 the engagements on the part of the union might at any moment be
 violated by its members and while they found from experience that
 they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets
 without granting us any return but such as their momentary
 convenience might suggest it is not therefore to be wondered at
 that mr jenkinson in ushering into the house of commons a bill for
 regulating the temporary intercourse between the two countries
 should preface its introduction by a declaration that similar
 provisions in former bills had been found to answer every purpose to
 the commerce of great britain and that it would be prudent to
 persist in the plan until it should appear whether the american
 government was likely or not to acquire greater consistency 
several states have endeavored by separate prohibitions
 restrictions and exclusions to influence the conduct of that
 kingdom in this particular but the want of concert arising from
 the want of a general authority and from clashing and dissimilar
 views in the state has hitherto frustrated every experiment of the
 kind and will continue to do so as long as the same obstacles to a
 uniformity of measures continue to exist
the interfering and unneighborly regulations of some states
 contrary to the true spirit of the union have in different
 instances given just cause of umbrage and complaint to others and
 it is to be feared that examples of this nature if not restrained
 by a national control would be multiplied and extended till they
 became not less serious sources of animosity and discord than
 injurious impediments to the intcrcourse between the different parts
 of the confederacy the commerce of the german empire  is in
 continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the
 several princes and states exact upon the merchandises passing
 through their territories by means of which the fine streams and
 navigable rivers with which germany is so happily watered are
 rendered almost useless though the genius of the people of this
 country might never permit this description to be strictly
 applicable to us yet we may reasonably expect from the gradual
 conflicts of state regulations that the citizens of each would at
 length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better
 light than that of foreigners and aliens
the power of raising armies by the most obvious construction of
 the articles of the confederation is merely a power of making
 requisitions upon the states for quotas of men this practice in
 the course of the late war was found replete with obstructions to a
 vigorous and to an economical system of defense it gave birth to a
 competition between the states which created a kind of auction for
 men in order to furnish the quotas required of them they outbid
 each other till bounties grew to an enormous and insupportable size
 the hope of a still further increase afforded an inducement to
 those who were disposed to serve to procrastinate their enlistment
 and disinclined them from engaging for any considerable periods
 hence slow and scanty levies of men in the most critical
 emergencies of our affairs short enlistments at an unparalleled
 expense continual fluctuations in the troops ruinous to their
 discipline and subjecting the public safety frequently to the
 perilous crisis of a disbanded army hence also those oppressive
 expedients for raising men which were upon several occasions
 practiced and which nothing but the enthusiasm of liberty would
 have induced the people to endure
this method of raising troops is not more unfriendly to economy
 and vigor than it is to an equal distribution of the burden the
 states near the seat of war influenced by motives of
 selfpreservation made efforts to furnish their quotas which even
 exceeded their abilities while those at a distance from danger
 were for the most part as remiss as the others were diligent in
 their exertions the immediate pressure of this inequality was not
 in this case as in that of the contributions of money alleviated
 by the hope of a final liquidation the states which did not pay
 their proportions of money might at least be charged with their
 deficiencies but no account could be formed of the deficiencies in
 the supplies of men we shall not however see much reason to
 reget the want of this hope when we consider how little prospect
 there is that the most delinquent states will ever be able to make
 compensation for their pecuniary failures the system of quotas and
 requisitions whether it be applied to men or money is in every
 view a system of imbecility in the union and of inequality and
 injustice among the members
the right of equal suffrage among the states is another
 exceptionable part of the confederation every idea of proportion
 and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a
 principle which gives to rhode island an equal weight in the scale
 of power with massachusetts or connecticut or new york and to
 deleware an equal voice in the national deliberations with
 pennsylvania or virginia or north carolina its operation
 contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government which
 requires that the sense of the majority should prevail sophistry
 may reply that sovereigns are equal and that a majority of the
 votes of the states will be a majority of confederated america but
 this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain
 suggestions of justice and commonsense it may happen that this
 majority of states is a small minority of the people of
 america  and two thirds of the people of america could not
 long be persuaded upon the credit of artificial distinctions and
 syllogistic subtleties to submit their interests to the management
 and disposal of one third the larger states would after a while
 revolt from the idea of receiving the law from the smaller to
 acquiesce in such a privation of their due importance in the
 political scale would be not merely to be insensible to the love of
 power but even to sacrifice the desire of equality it is neither
 rational to expect the first nor just to require the last the
 smaller states considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare
 depend on union ought readily to renounce a pretension which if
 not relinquished would prove fatal to its duration
it may be objected to this that not seven but nine states or
 two thirds of the whole number must consent to the most important
 resolutions and it may be thence inferred that nine states would
 always comprehend a majority of the union but this does not
 obviate the impropriety of an equal vote between states of the most
 unequal dimensions and populousness nor is the inference accurate
 in point of fact for we can enumerate nine states which contain
 less than a majority of the people  and it is constitutionally
 possible that these nine may give the vote besides there are
 matters of considerable moment determinable by a bare majority and
 there are others concerning which doubts have been entertained
 which if interpreted in favor of the sufficiency of a vote of seven
 states would extend its operation to interests of the first
 magnitude in addition to this it is to be observed that there is
 a probability of an increase in the number of states and no
 provision for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes
but this is not all what at first sight may seem a remedy is
 in reality a poison to give a minority a negative upon the
 majority which is always the case where more than a majority is
 requisite to a decision is in its tendency to subject the sense
 of the greater number to that of the lesser congress from the
 nonattendance of a few states have been frequently in the situation
 of a polish diet where a single vote has been sufficient to put a
 stop to all their movements a sixtieth part of the union which is
 about the proportion of delaware and rhode island has several times
 been able to oppose an entire bar to its operations this is one of
 those refinements which in practice has an effect the reverse of
 what is expected from it in theory the necessity of unanimity in
 public bodies or of something approaching towards it has been
 founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security
 but its real operation is to embarrass the administration to
 destroy the energy of the government and to substitute the
 pleasure caprice or artifices of an insignificant turbulent or
 corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a
 respectable majority in those emergencies of a nation in which
 the goodness or badness the weakness or strength of its government
 is of the greatest importance there is commonly a necessity for
 action the public business must in some way or other go forward
 if a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority
 respecting the best mode of conducting it the majority in order
 that something may be done must conform to the views of the
 minority and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule
 that of the greater and give a tone to the national proceedings
 hence tedious delays continual negotiation and intrigue
 contemptible compromises of the public good and yet in such a
 system it is even happy when such compromises can take place for
 upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation and
 then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended or
 fatally defeated it is often by the impracticability of obtaining
 the concurrence of the necessary number of votes kept in a state of
 inaction its situation must always savor of weakness sometimes
 border upon anarchy
it is not difficult to discover that a principle of this kind
 gives greater scope to foreign corruption as well as to domestic
 faction than that which permits the sense of the majority to
 decide though the contrary of this has been presumed the mistake
 has proceeded from not attending with due care to the mischiefs that
 may be occasioned by obstructing the progress of government at
 certain critical seasons when the concurrence of a large number is
 required by the constitution to the doing of any national act we
 are apt to rest satisfied that all is safe because nothing improper
 will be likely to be done but we forget how much good may be
 prevented and how much ill may be produced by the power of
 hindering the doing what may be necessary and of keeping affairs in
 the same unfavorable posture in which they may happen to stand at
 particular periods
suppose for instance we were engaged in a war in conjunction
 with one foreign nation against another suppose the necessity of
 our situation demanded peace and the interest or ambition of our
 ally led him to seek the prosecution of the war with views that
 might justify us in making separate terms in such a state of
 things this ally of ours would evidently find it much easier by
 his bribes and intrigues to tie up the hands of government from
 making peace where two thirds of all the votes were requisite to
 that object than where a simple majority would suffice in the
 first case he would have to corrupt a smaller number in the last
 a greater number upon the same principle it would be much easier
 for a foreign power with which we were at war to perplex our
 councils and embarrass our exertions and in a commercial view we
 may be subjected to similar inconveniences a nation with which we
 might have a treaty of commerce could with much greater facility
 prevent our forming a connection with her competitor in trade
 though such a connection should be ever so beneficial to ourselves
evils of this description ought not to be regarded as imaginary
 one of the weak sides of republics among their numerous
 advantages is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign
 corruption an hereditary monarch though often disposed to
 sacrifice his subjects to his ambition has so great a personal
 interest in the government and in the external glory of the nation
 that it is not easy for a foreign power to give him an equivalent
 for what he would sacrifice by treachery to the state the world
 has accordingly been witness to few examples of this species of
 royal prostitution though there have been abundant specimens of
 every other kind
in republics persons elevated from the mass of the community
 by the suffrages of their fellowcitizens to stations of great
 preeminence and power may find compensations for betraying their
 trust which to any but minds animated and guided by superior
 virtue may appear to exceed the proportion of interest they have in
 the common stock and to overbalance the obligations of duty hence
 it is that history furnishes us with so many mortifying examples of
 the prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments how
 much this contributed to the ruin of the ancient commonwealths has
 been already delineated it is well known that the deputies of the
 united provinces have in various instances been purchased by the
 emissaries of the neighboring kingdoms the earl of chesterfield
 if my memory serves me right in a letter to his court intimates
 that his success in an important negotiation must depend on his
 obtaining a majors commission for one of those deputies and in
 sweden the parties were alternately bought by france and england in
 so barefaced and notorious a manner that it excited universal
 disgust in the nation and was a principal cause that the most
 limited monarch in europe in a single day without tumult
 violence or opposition became one of the most absolute and
 uncontrolled
a circumstance which crowns the defects of the confederation
 remains yet to be mentioned the want of a judiciary power laws
 are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true
 meaning and operation the treaties of the united states to have
 any force at all must be considered as part of the law of the land
 their true import as far as respects individuals must like all
 other laws be ascertained by judicial determinations to produce
 uniformity in these determinations they ought to be submitted in
 the last resort to one supreme tribunal and this tribunal ought
 to be instituted under the same authority which forms the treaties
 themselves these ingredients are both indispensable if there is
 in each state a court of final jurisdiction there may be as many
 different final determinations on the same point as there are courts
 there are endless diversities in the opinions of men we often
 see not only different courts but the judges of the came court
 differing from each other to avoid the confusion which would
 unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of
 independent judicatories all nations have found it necessary to
 establish one court paramount to the rest possessing a general
 superintendence and authorized to settle and declare in the last
 resort a uniform rule of civil justice
this is the more necessary where the frame of the government is
 so compounded that the laws of the whole are in danger of being
 contravened by the laws of the parts in this case if the
 particular tribunals are invested with a right of ultimate
 jurisdiction besides the contradictions to be expected from
 difference of opinion there will be much to fear from the bias of
 local views and prejudices and from the interference of local
 regulations as often as such an interference was to happen there
 would be reason to apprehend that the provisions of the particular
 laws might be preferred to those of the general laws for nothing
 is more natural to men in office than to look with peculiar
 deference towards that authority to which they owe their official
 existence the treaties of the united states under the present
 constitution are liable to the infractions of thirteen different
 legislatures and as many different courts of final jurisdiction
 acting under the authority of those legislatures the faith the
 reputation the peace of the whole union are thus continually at
 the mercy of the prejudices the passions and the interests of
 every member of which it is composed is it possible that foreign
 nations can either respect or confide in such a government is it
 possible that the people of america will longer consent to trust
 their honor their happiness their safety on so precarious a
 foundation
in this review of the confederation i have confined myself to
 the exhibition of its most material defects passing over those
 imperfections in its details by which even a great part of the power
 intended to be conferred upon it has been in a great measure
 rendered abortive it must be by this time evident to all men of
 reflection who can divest themselves of the prepossessions of
 preconceived opinions that it is a system so radically vicious and
 unsound as to admit not of amendment but by an entire change in its
 leading features and characters
the organization of congress is itself utterly improper for the
 exercise of those powers which are necessary to be deposited in the
 union a single assembly may be a proper receptacle of those
 slender or rather fettered authorities which have been heretofore
 delegated to the federal head but it would be inconsistent with
 all the principles of good government to intrust it with those
 additional powers which even the moderate and more rational
 adversaries of the proposed constitution admit ought to reside in
 the united states if that plan should not be adopted and if the
 necessity of the union should be able to withstand the ambitious
 aims of those men who may indulge magnificent schemes of personal
 aggrandizement from its dissolution the probability would be that
 we should run into the project of conferring supplementary powers
 upon congress as they are now constituted and either the machine
 from the intrinsic feebleness of its structure will moulder into
 pieces in spite of our illjudged efforts to prop it or by
 successive augmentations of its force an energy as necessity might
 prompt we shall finally accumulate in a single body all the most
 important prerogatives of sovereignty and thus entail upon our
 posterity one of the most execrable forms of government that human
 infatuation ever contrived thus we should create in reality that
 very tyranny which the adversaries of the new constitution either
 are or affect to be solicitous to avert
it has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the
 existing federal system that it never had a ratification by the
 people resting on no better foundation than the consent of the
 several legislatures it has been exposed to frequent and intricate
 questions concerning the validity of its powers and has in some
 instances given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of
 legislative repeal owing its ratification to the law of a state
 it has been contended that the same authority might repeal the law
 by which it was ratified however gross a heresy it may be to
 maintain that a party to a compact has a right to revoke that
 compact the doctrine itself has had respectable advocates the
 possibility of a question of this nature proves the necessity of
 laying the foundations of our national government deeper than in the
 mere sanction of delegated authority the fabric of american empire
 ought to rest on the solid basis of the consent of the people the
 streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure
 original fountain of all legitimate authority

the necessity of a government as energetic as the one proposed to
 the preservation of the union
from the new york packet
tuesday december  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the necessity of a constitution at least equally energetic with
 the one proposed to the preservation of the union is the point at
 the examination of which we are now arrived
this inquiry will naturally divide itself into three
 branches the objects to be provided for by the federal government
 the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those
 objects the persons upon whom that power ought to operate its
 distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention
 under the succeeding head
the principal purposes to be answered by union are these the
 common defense of the members the preservation of the public peace
 as well against internal convulsions as external attacks the
 regulation of commerce with other nations and between the states
 the superintendence of our intercourse political and commercial
 with foreign countries
the authorities essential to the common defense are these to
 raise armies to build and equip fleets to prescribe rules for
 the government of both to direct their operations to provide for
 their support these powers ought to exist without limitation
 because it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety
 of national exigencies or the correspondent extent and variety of
 the means which may be necessary to satisfy them the circumstances
 that endanger the safety of nations are infinite and for this
 reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power
 to which the care of it is committed this power ought to be
 coextensive with all the possible combinations of such
 circumstances and ought to be under the direction of the same
 councils which are appointed to preside over the common defense
this is one of those truths which to a correct and unprejudiced
 mind carries its own evidence along with it and may be obscured
 but cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning it rests upon
 axioms as simple as they are universal the means ought to be
 proportioned to the end the persons from whose agency the
 attainment of any end is expected ought to possess the means by
 which it is to be attained
whether there ought to be a federal government intrusted with
 the care of the common defense is a question in the first instance
 open for discussion but the moment it is decided in the
 affirmative it will follow that that government ought to be
 clothed with all the powers requisite to complete execution of its
 trust and unless it can be shown that the circumstances which may
 affect the public safety are reducible within certain determinate
 limits unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and
 rationally disputed it must be admitted as a necessary
 consequence that there can be no limitation of that authority which
 is to provide for the defense and protection of the community in
 any matter essential to its efficacy that is in any matter
 essential to the formation direction or support of the national
 forces
defective as the present confederation has been proved to be
 this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the framers
 of it though they have not made proper or adequate provision for
 its exercise congress have an unlimited discretion to make
 requisitions of men and money to govern the army and navy to
 direct their operations as their requisitions are made
 constitutionally binding upon the states who are in fact under the
 most solemn obligations to furnish the supplies required of them
 the intention evidently was that the united states should command
 whatever resources were by them judged requisite to the common
 defense and general welfare it was presumed that a sense of
 their true interests and a regard to the dictates of good faith
 would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual performance of
 the duty of the members to the federal head
the experiment has however demonstrated that this expectation
 was illfounded and illusory and the observations made under the
 last head will i imagine have sufficed to convince the impartial
 and discerning that there is an absolute necessity for an entire
 change in the first principles of the system that if we are in
 earnest about giving the union energy and duration we must abandon
 the vain project of legislating upon the states in their collective
 capacities we must extend the laws of the federal government to
 the individual citizens of america we must discard the fallacious
 scheme of quotas and requisitions as equally impracticable and
 unjust the result from all this is that the union ought to be
 invested with full power to levy troops to build and equip fleets
 and to raise the revenues which will be required for the formation
 and support of an army and navy in the customary and ordinary modes
 practiced in other governments
if the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a
 compound instead of a simple a confederate instead of a sole
 government the essential point which will remain to be adjusted
 will be to discriminate the objects as far as it can be done which
 shall appertain to the different provinces or departments of power
 allowing to each the most ample authority for fulfilling the
 objects committed to its charge shall the union be constituted the
 guardian of the common safety are fleets and armies and revenues
 necessary to this purpose the government of the union must be
 empowered to pass all laws and to make all regulations which have
 relation to them the same must be the case in respect to commerce
 and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is permitted to
 extend is the administration of justice between the citizens of
 the same state the proper department of the local governments
 these must possess all the authorities which are connected with
 this object and with every other that may be allotted to their
 particular cognizance and direction not to confer in each case a
 degree of power commensurate to the end would be to violate the
 most obvious rules of prudence and propriety and improvidently to
 trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled
 from managing them with vigor and success
who is likely to make suitable provisions for the public
 defense as that body to which the guardianship of the public safety
 is confided which as the centre of information will best
 understand the extent and urgency of the dangers that threaten as
 the representative of the whole will feel itself most deeply
 interested in the preservation of every part which from the
 responsibility implied in the duty assigned to it will be most
 sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper exertions and
 which by the extension of its authority throughout the states can
 alone establish uniformity and concert in the plans and measures by
 which the common safety is to be secured is there not a manifest
 inconsistency in devolving upon the federal government the care of
 the general defense and leaving in the state governments the
 effective powers by which it is to be provided for is not a want
 of cooperation the infallible consequence of such a system and
 will not weakness disorder an undue distribution of the burdens
 and calamities of war an unnecessary and intolerable increase of
 expense be its natural and inevitable concomitants have we not
 had unequivocal experience of its effects in the course of the
 revolution which we have just accomplished
every view we may take of the subject as candid inquirers after
 truth will serve to convince us that it is both unwise and
 dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority as
 to all those objects which are intrusted to its management it will
 indeed deserve the most vigilant and careful attention of the
 people to see that it be modeled in such a manner as to admit of
 its being safely vested with the requisite powers if any plan
 which has been or may be offered to our consideration should not
 upon a dispassionate inspection be found to answer this
 description it ought to be rejected a government the
 constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the
 powers which a free people ought to delegate to any government
 would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the national interests
 wherever these can with propriety be confided the coincident
 powers may safely accompany them this is the true result of all
 just reasoning upon the subject and the adversaries of the plan
 promulgated by the convention ought to have confined themselves to
 showing that the internal structure of the proposed government was
 such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people they
 ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and
 unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers the powers are not
 too extensive for the objects of federal administration or in
 other words for the management of our national interests nor can
 any satisfactory argument be framed to show that they are chargeable
 with such an excess if it be true as has been insinuated by some
 of the writers on the other side that the difficulty arises from
 the nature of the thing and that the extent of the country will not
 permit us to form a government in which such ample powers can safely
 be reposed it would prove that we ought to contract our views and
 resort to the expedient of separate confederacies which will move
 within more practicable spheres for the absurdity must continually
 stare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of
 the most essential national interests without daring to trust it to
 the authorities which are indispensible to their proper and
 efficient management let us not attempt to reconcile
 contradictions but firmly embrace a rational alternative
i trust however that the impracticability of one general
 system cannot be shown i am greatly mistaken if any thing of
 weight has yet been advanced of this tendency and i flatter
 myself that the observations which have been made in the course of
 these papers have served to place the reverse of that position in as
 clear a light as any matter still in the womb of time and experience
 can be susceptible of this at all events must be evident that
 the very difficulty itself drawn from the extent of the country is
 the strongest argument in favor of an energetic government for any
 other can certainly never preserve the union of so large an empire
 if we embrace the tenets of those who oppose the adoption of the
 proposed constitution as the standard of our political creed we
 cannot fail to verify the gloomy doctrines which predict the
 impracticability of a national system pervading entire limits of the
 present confederacy

the powers necessary to the common defense further considered
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
to the powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal
 government in respect to the creation and direction of the national
 forces i have met with but one specific objection which if i
 understand it right is this that proper provision has not been
 made against the existence of standing armies in time of peace an
 objection which i shall now endeavor to show rests on weak and
 unsubstantial foundations
it has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general
 form supported only by bold assertions without the appearance of
 argument without even the sanction of theoretical opinions in
 contradiction to the practice of other free nations and to the
 general sense of america as expressed in most of the existing
 constitutions the proprietory of this remark will appear the
 moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration
 turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the legislative
 authority of the nation in the article of military establishments
 a principle unheard of except in one or two of our state
 constitutions and rejected in all the rest
a stranger to our politics who was to read our newspapers at
 the present juncture without having previously inspected the plan
 reported by the convention would be naturally led to one of two
 conclusions either that it contained a positive injunction that
 standing armies should be kept up in time of peace or that it
 vested in the executive the whole power of levying troops without
 subjecting his discretion in any shape to the control of the
 legislature
if he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself he would be
 surprised to discover that neither the one nor the other was the
 case that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the
 legislature not in the executive that this legislature was to be
 a popular body consisting of the representatives of the people
 periodically elected and that instead of the provision he had
 supposed in favor of standing armies there was to be found in
 respect to this object an important qualification even of the
 legislative discretion in that clause which forbids the
 appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer
 period than two years a precaution which upon a nearer view of it
 will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up
 of troops without evident necessity
disappointed in his first surmise the person i have supposed
 would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further he would
 naturally say to himself it is impossible that all this vehement
 and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable pretext it
 must needs be that this people so jealous of their liberties have
 in all the preceding models of the constitutions which they have
 established inserted the most precise and rigid precautions on this
 point the omission of which in the new plan has given birth to
 all this apprehension and clamor
if under this impression he proceeded to pass in review the
 several state constitutions how great would be his disappointment
 to find that two only of them  contained an interdiction of
 standing armies in time of peace that the other eleven had either
 observed a profound silence on the subject or had in express terms
 admitted the right of the legislature to authorize their existence
still however he would be persuaded that there must be some
 plausible foundation for the cry raised on this head he would
 never be able to imagine while any source of information remained
 unexplored that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the
 public credulity dictated either by a deliberate intention to
 deceive or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be
 ingenuous it would probably occur to him that he would be likely
 to find the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact
 between the states here at length he would expect to meet with a
 solution of the enigma no doubt he would observe to himself the
 existing confederation must contain the most explicit provisions
 against military establishments in time of peace and a departure
 from this model in a favorite point has occasioned the discontent
 which appears to influence these political champions
if he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey
 of the articles of confederation his astonishment would not only be
 increased but would acquire a mixture of indignation at the
 unexpected discovery that these articles instead of containing the
 prohibition he looked for and though they had with jealous
 circumspection restricted the authority of the state legislatures
 in this particular had not imposed a single restraint on that of
 the united states if he happened to be a man of quick sensibility
 or ardent temper he could now no longer refrain from regarding
 these clamors as the dishonest artifices of a sinister and
 unprincipled opposition to a plan which ought at least to receive a
 fair and candid examination from all sincere lovers of their
 country how else he would say could the authors of them have
 been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that plan about a
 point in which it seems to have conformed itself to the general
 sense of america as declared in its different forms of government
 and in which it has even superadded a new and powerful guard unknown
 to any of them if on the contrary he happened to be a man of
 calm and dispassionate feelings he would indulge a sigh for the
 frailty of human nature and would lament that in a matter so
 interesting to the happiness of millions the true merits of the
 question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients so
 unfriendly to an impartial and right determination even such a man
 could hardly forbear remarking that a conduct of this kind has too
 much the appearance of an intention to mislead the people by
 alarming their passions rather than to convince them by arguments
 addressed to their understandings
but however little this objection may be countenanced even by
 precedents among ourselves it may be satisfactory to take a nearer
 view of its intrinsic merits from a close examination it will
 appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in
 respect to military establishments in time of peace would be
 improper to be imposed and if imposed from the necessities of
 society would be unlikely to be observed
though a wide ocean separates the united states from europe yet
 there are various considerations that warn us against an excess of
 confidence or security on one side of us and stretching far into
 our rear are growing settlements subject to the dominion of britain
 on the other side and extending to meet the british settlements
 are colonies and establishments subject to the dominion of spain
 this situation and the vicinity of the west india islands
 belonging to these two powers create between them in respect to
 their american possessions and in relation to us a common interest
 the savage tribes on our western frontier ought to be regarded as
 our natural enemies their natural allies because they have most to
 fear from us and most to hope from them the improvements in the
 art of navigation have as to the facility of communication
 rendered distant nations in a great measure neighbors britain
 and spain are among the principal maritime powers of europe a
 future concert of views between these nations ought not to be
 regarded as improbable the increasing remoteness of consanguinity
 is every day diminishing the force of the family compact between
 france and spain and politicians have ever with great reason
 considered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of
 political connection these circumstances combined admonish us not
 to be too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the
 reach of danger
previous to the revolution and ever since the peace there has
 been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our western
 frontier no person can doubt that these will continue to be
 indispensable if it should only be against the ravages and
 depredations of the indians these garrisons must either be
 furnished by occasional detachments from the militia or by
 permanent corps in the pay of the government the first is
 impracticable and if practicable would be pernicious the
 militia would not long if at all submit to be dragged from their
 occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in
 times of profound peace and if they could be prevailed upon or
 compelled to do it the increased expense of a frequent rotation of
 service and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the industrious
 pursuits of individuals would form conclusive objections to the
 scheme it would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as
 ruinous to private citizens the latter resource of permanent corps
 in the pay of the government amounts to a standing army in time of
 peace a small one indeed but not the less real for being small
 here is a simple view of the subject that shows us at once the
 impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments
 and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and
 prudence of the legislature
in proportion to our increase in strength it is probable nay
 it may be said certain that britain and spain would augment their
 military establishments in our neighborhood if we should not be
 willing to be exposed in a naked and defenseless condition to
 their insults and encroachments we should find it expedient to
 increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which
 our western settlements might be annoyed there are and will be
 particular posts the possession of which will include the command
 of large districts of territory and facilitate future invasions of
 the remainder it may be added that some of those posts will be
 keys to the trade with the indian nations can any man think it
 would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any
 instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable
 powers to act this part would be to desert all the usual maxims of
 prudence and policy
if we mean to be a commercial people or even to be secure on
 our atlantic side we must endeavor as soon as possible to have a
 navy to this purpose there must be dockyards and arsenals and
 for the defense of these fortifications and probably garrisons
 when a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its
 dockyards by its fleets this supersedes the necessity of garrisons
 for that purpose but where naval establishments are in their
 infancy moderate garrisons will in all likelihood be found an
 indispensable security against descents for the destruction of the
 arsenals and dockyards and sometimes of the fleet itself
publius
fna this statement of the matter is taken from the printed
 collection of state constitutions pennsylvania and north carolina
 are the two which contain the interdiction in these words as
 standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty they
 ought not to be kept up this is in truth rather a caution than
 a prohibition new hampshire massachusetts delaware and maryland
 have in each of their bils of rights a clause to this effect
 standing armies are dangerous to liberty and ought not to be
 raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature which
 is a formal admission of the authority of the legislature new york
 has no bills of rights and her constitution says not a word about
 the matter no bills of rights appear annexed to the constitutions
 of the other states except the foregoing and their constitutions
 are equally silent i am told however that one or two states have
 bills of rights which do not appear in this collection but that
 those also recognize the right of the legislative authority in this
 respect

the same subject continued
the powers necessary to the common defense further considered
from the new york packet
friday december  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
it may perhaps be urged that the objects enumerated in the
 preceding number ought to be provided for by the state governments
 under the direction of the union but this would be in reality an
 inversion of the primary principle of our political association as
 it would in practice transfer the care of the common defense from
 the federal head to the individual members a project oppressive to
 some states dangerous to all and baneful to the confederacy
the territories of britain spain and of the indian nations in
 our neighborhood do not border on particular states but encircle
 the union from maine to georgia the danger though in different
 degrees is therefore common and the means of guarding against it
 ought in like manner to be the objects of common councils and of a
 common treasury it happens that some states from local situation
 are more directly exposed new york is of this class upon the
 plan of separate provisions new york would have to sustain the
 whole weight of the establishments requisite to her immediate
 safety and to the mediate or ultimate protection of her neighbors
 this would neither be equitable as it respected new york nor safe
 as it respected the other states various inconveniences would
 attend such a system the states to whose lot it might fall to
 support the necessary establishments would be as little able as
 willing for a considerable time to come to bear the burden of
 competent provisions the security of all would thus be subjected
 to the parsimony improvidence or inability of a part if the
 resources of such part becoming more abundant and extensive its
 provisions should be proportionally enlarged the other states would
 quickly take the alarm at seeing the whole military force of the
 union in the hands of two or three of its members and those
 probably amongst the most powerful they would each choose to have
 some counterpoise and pretenses could easily be contrived in this
 situation military establishments nourished by mutual jealousy
 would be apt to swell beyond their natural or proper size and
 being at the separate disposal of the members they would be engines
 for the abridgment or demolition of the national authcrity
reasons have been already given to induce a supposition that the
 state governments will too naturally be prone to a rivalship with
 that of the union the foundation of which will be the love of
 power and that in any contest between the federal head and one of
 its members the people will be most apt to unite with their local
 government if in addition to this immense advantage the ambition
 of the members should be stimulated by the separate and independent
 possession of military forces it would afford too strong a
 temptation and too great a facility to them to make enterprises
 upon and finally to subvert the constitutional authority of the
 union on the other hand the liberty of the people would be less
 safe in this state of things than in that which left the national
 forces in the hands of the national government as far as an army
 may be considered as a dangerous weapon of power it had better be
 in those hands of which the people are most likely to be jealous
 than in those of which they are least likely to be jealous for it
 is a truth which the experience of ages has attested that the
 people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their
 rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the
 least suspicion
the framers of the existing confederation fully aware of the
 danger to the union from the separate possession of military forces
 by the states have in express terms prohibited them from having
 either ships or troops unless with the consent of congress the
 truth is that the existence of a federal government and military
 establishments under state authority are not less at variance with
 each other than a due supply of the federal treasury and the system
 of quotas and requisitions
there are other lights besides those already taken notice of in
 which the impropriety of restraints on the discretion of the
 national legislature will be equally manifest the design of the
 objection which has been mentioned is to preclude standing armies
 in time of peace though we have never been informed how far it is
 designed the prohibition should extend whether to raising armies
 as well as to keeping them up in a season of tranquillity or not
 if it be confined to the latter it will have no precise
 signification and it will be ineffectual for the purpose intended
 when armies are once raised what shall be denominated keeping
 them up contrary to the sense of the constitution what time
 shall be requisite to ascertain the violation shall it be a week
 a month a year or shall we say they may be continued as long as
 the danger which occasioned their being raised continues this
 would be to admit that they might be kept up in time of peace
 against threatening or impending danger which would be at once to
 deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition and to
 introduce an extensive latitude of construction who shall judge of
 the continuance of the danger this must undoubtedly be submitted
 to the national government and the matter would then be brought to
 this issue that the national government to provide against
 apprehended danger might in the first instance raise troops and
 might afterwards keep them on foot as long as they supposed the
 peace or safety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy it
 is easy to perceive that a discretion so latitudinary as this would
 afford ample room for eluding the force of the provision
the supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be
 founded on the supposed probability or at least possibility of a
 combination between the executive and the legislative in some
 scheme of usurpation should this at any time happen how easy
 would it be to fabricate pretenses of approaching danger indian
 hostilities instigated by spain or britain would always be at hand
 provocations to produce the desired appearances might even be
 given to some foreign power and appeased again by timely
 concessions if we can reasonably presume such a combination to
 have been formed and that the enterprise is warranted by a
 sufficient prospect of success the army when once raised from
 whatever cause or on whatever pretext may be applied to the
 execution of the project
if to obviate this consequence it should be resolved to extend
 the prohibition to the raising of armies in time of peace the
 united states would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle
 which the world has yet seen that of a nation incapacitated by its
 constitution to prepare for defense before it was actually invaded
 as the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen
 into disuse the presence of an enemy within our territories must be
 waited for as the legal warrant to the government to begin its
 levies of men for the protection of the state we must receive the
 blow before we could even prepare to return it all that kind of
 policy by which nations anticipate distant danger and meet the
 gathering storm must be abstained from as contrary to the genuine
 maxims of a free government we must expose our property and
 liberty to the mercy of foreign invaders and invite them by our
 weakness to seize the naked and defenseless prey because we are
 afraid that rulers created by our choice dependent on our will
 might endanger that liberty by an abuse of the means necessary to
 its preservation
here i expect we shall be told that the militia of the country
 is its natural bulwark and would be at all times equal to the
 national defense this doctrine in substance had like to have
 lost us our independence it cost millions to the united states
 that might have been saved the facts which from our own
 experience forbid a reliance of this kind are too recent to permit
 us to be the dupes of such a suggestion the steady operations of
 war against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully
 conducted by a force of the same kind considerations of economy
 not less than of stability and vigor confirm this position the
 american militia in the course of the late war have by their
 valor on numerous occasions erected eternal monuments to their
 fame but the bravest of them feel and know that the liberty of
 their country could not have been established by their efforts
 alone however great and valuable they were war like most other
 things is a science to be acquired and perfected by diligence by
 perserverance by time and by practice
all violent policy as it is contrary to the natural and
 experienced course of human affairs defeats itself pennsylvania
 at this instant affords an example of the truth of this remark
 the bill of rights of that state declares that standing armies are
 dangerous to liberty and ought not to be kept up in time of peace
 pennsylvania nevertheless in a time of profound peace from the
 existence of partial disorders in one or two of her counties has
 resolved to raise a body of troops and in all probability will
 keep them up as long as there is any appearance of danger to the
 public peace the conduct of massachusetts affords a lesson on the
 same subject though on different ground that state without
 waiting for the sanction of congress as the articles of the
 confederation require was compelled to raise troops to quell a
 domestic insurrection and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a
 revival of the spirit of revolt the particular constitution of
 massachusetts opposed no obstacle to the measure but the instance
 is still of use to instruct us that cases are likely to occur under
 our government as well as under those of other nations which will
 sometimes render a military force in time of peace essential to the
 security of the society and that it is therefore improper in this
 respect to control the legislative discretion it also teaches us
 in its application to the united states how little the rights of a
 feeble government are likely to be respected even by its own
 constituents and it teaches us in addition to the rest how
 unequal parchment provisions are to a struggle with public necessity
it was a fundamental maxim of the lacedaemonian commonwealth
 that the post of admiral should not be conferred twice on the same
 person the peloponnesian confederates having suffered a severe
 defeat at sea from the athenians demanded lysander who had before
 served with success in that capacity to command the combined fleets
 the lacedaemonians to gratify their allies and yet preserve the
 semblance of an adherence to their ancient institutions had
 recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of investing lysander with the
 real power of admiral under the nominal title of viceadmiral
 this instance is selected from among a multitude that might be
 cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illustrated by
 domestic examples which is that nations pay little regard to
 rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to
 the necessities of society wise politicians will be cautious about
 fettering the government with restrictions that cannot be observed
 because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws though
 dictated by necessity impairs that sacred reverence which ought to
 be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a
 country and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same
 plea of necessity does not exist at all or is less urgent and
 palpable
publius

the idea of restraining the legislative authority in regard to the
 common defense considered
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
it was a thing hardly to be expected that in a popular
 revolution the minds of men should stop at that happy mean which
 marks the salutary boundary between power and privilege and
 combines the energy of government with the security of private
 rights a failure in this delicate and important point is the great
 source of the inconveniences we experience and if we are not
 cautious to avoid a repetition of the error in our future attempts
 to rectify and ameliorate our system we may travel from one
 chimerical project to another we may try change after change but
 we shall never be likely to make any material change for the better
the idea of restraining the legislative authority in the means
 of providing for the national defense is one of those refinements
 which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than
 enlightened we have seen however that it has not had thus far an
 extensive prevalency that even in this country where it made its
 first appearance pennsylvania and north carolina are the only two
 states by which it has been in any degree patronized and that all
 the others have refused to give it the least countenance wisely
 judging that confidence must be placed somewhere that the
 necessity of doing it is implied in the very act of delegating
 power and that it is better to hazard the abuse of that confidence
 than to embarrass the government and endanger the public safety by
 impolitic restrictions on the legislative authority the opponents
 of the proposed constitution combat in this respect the general
 decision of america and instead of being taught by experience the
 propriety of correcting any extremes into which we may have
 heretofore run they appear disposed to conduct us into others still
 more dangerous and more extravagant as if the tone of government
 had been found too high or too rigid the doctrines they teach are
 calculated to induce us to depress or to relax it by expedients
 which upon other occasions have been condemned or forborne it
 may be affirmed without the imputation of invective that if the
 principles they inculcate on various points could so far obtain as
 to become the popular creed they would utterly unfit the people of
 this country for any species of government whatever but a danger
 of this kind is not to be apprehended the citizens of america have
 too much discernment to be argued into anarchy and i am much
 mistaken if experience has not wrought a deep and solemn conviction
 in the public mind that greater energy of government is essential
 to the welfare and prosperity of the community
it may not be amiss in this place concisely to remark the origin
 and progress of the idea which aims at the exclusion of military
 establishments in time of peace though in speculative minds it may
 arise from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of such
 institutions fortified by the events that have happened in other
 ages and countries yet as a national sentiment it must be traced
 to those habits of thinking which we derive from the nation from
 whom the inhabitants of these states have in general sprung
in england for a long time after the norman conquest the
 authority of the monarch was almost unlimited inroads were
 gradually made upon the prerogative in favor of liberty first by
 the barons and afterwards by the people till the greatest part of
 its most formidable pretensions became extinct but it was not till
 the revolution in  which elevated the prince of orange to the
 throne of great britain that english liberty was completely
 triumphant as incident to the undefined power of making war an
 acknowledged prerogative of the crown charles ii had by his own
 authority kept on foot in time of peace a body of  regular
 troops and this number james ii increased to  who were
 paid out of his civil list at the revolution to abolish the
 exercise of so dangerous an authority it became an article of the
 bill of rights then framed that the raising or keeping a standing
 army within the kingdom in time of peace unless with the consent of
 parliament was against law
in that kingdom when the pulse of liberty was at its highest
 pitch no security against the danger of standing armies was thought
 requisite beyond a prohibition of their being raised or kept up by
 the mere authority of the executive magistrate the patriots who
 effected that memorable revolution were too temperate too
 wellinformed to think of any restraint on the legislative
 discretion they were aware that a certain number of troops for
 guards and garrisons were indispensable that no precise bounds
 could be set to the national exigencies that a power equal to
 every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the government
 and that when they referred the exercise of that power to the
 judgment of the legislature they had arrived at the ultimate point
 of precaution which was reconcilable with the safety of the
 community
from the same source the people of america may be said to have
 derived an hereditary impression of danger to liberty from standing
 armies in time of peace the circumstances of a revolution
 quickened the public sensibility on every point connected with the
 security of popular rights and in some instances raise the warmth
 of our zeal beyond the degree which consisted with the due
 temperature of the body politic the attempts of two of the states
 to restrict the authority of the legislature in the article of
 military establishments are of the number of these instances the
 principles which had taught us to be jealous of the power of an
 hereditary monarch were by an injudicious excess extended to the
 representatives of the people in their popular assemblies even in
 some of the states where this error was not adopted we find
 unnecessary declarations that standing armies ought not to be kept
 up in time of peace without the consent of the legislature i
 call them unnecessary because the reason which had introduced a
 similar provision into the english bill of rights is not applicable
 to any of the state constitutions the power of raising armies at
 all under those constitutions can by no construction be deemed to
 reside anywhere else than in the legislatures themselves and it
 was superfluous if not absurd to declare that a matter should not
 be done without the consent of a body which alone had the power of
 doing it accordingly in some of these constitutions and among
 others in that of this state of new york which has been justly
 celebrated both in europe and america as one of the best of the
 forms of government established in this country there is a total
 silence upon the subject
it is remarkable that even in the two states which seem to have
 meditated an interdiction of military establishments in time of
 peace the mode of expression made use of is rather cautionary than
 prohibitory it is not said that standing armies shall not be kept
 up but that they ought not to be kept up in time of peace this
 ambiguity of terms appears to have been the result of a conflict
 between jealousy and conviction between the desire of excluding
 such establishments at all events and the persuasion that an
 absolute exclusion would be unwise and unsafe
can it be doubted that such a provision whenever the situation
 of public affairs was understood to require a departure from it
 would be interpreted by the legislature into a mere admonition and
 would be made to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of
 the state let the fact already mentioned with respect to
 pennsylvania decide what then it may be asked is the use of
 such a provision if it cease to operate the moment there is an
 inclination to disregard it
let us examine whether there be any comparison in point of
 efficacy between the provision alluded to and that which is
 contained in the new constitution for restraining the
 appropriations of money for military purposes to the period of two
 years the former by aiming at too much is calculated to effect
 nothing the latter by steering clear of an imprudent extreme and
 by being perfectly compatible with a proper provision for the
 exigencies of the nation will have a salutary and powerful
 operation
the legislature of the united states will be obliged by this
 provision once at least in every two years to deliberate upon the
 propriety of keeping a military force on foot to come to a new
 resolution on the point and to declare their sense of the matter
 by a formal vote in the face of their constituents they are not at
 liberty to vest in the executive department permanent funds for the
 support of an army if they were even incautious enough to be
 willing to repose in it so improper a confidence as the spirit of
 party in different degrees must be expected to infect all
 political bodies there will be no doubt persons in the national
 legislature willing enough to arraign the measures and criminate the
 views of the majority the provision for the support of a military
 force will always be a favorable topic for declamation as often as
 the question comes forward the public attention will be roused and
 attracted to the subject by the party in opposition and if the
 majority should be really disposed to exceed the proper limits the
 community will be warned of the danger and will have an opportunity
 of taking measures to guard against it independent of parties in
 the national legislature itself as often as the period of
 discussion arrived the state legislatures who will always be not
 only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of
 the citizens against encroachments from the federal government will
 constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national
 rulers and will be ready enough if any thing improper appears to
 sound the alarm to the people and not only to be the voice but if
 necessary the arm of their discontent
schemes to subvert the liberties of a great community require
 time to mature them for execution an army so large as seriously
 to menace those liberties could only be formed by progressive
 augmentations which would suppose not merely a temporary
 combination between the legislature and executive but a continued
 conspiracy for a series of time is it probable that such a
 combination would exist at all is it probable that it would be
 persevered in and transmitted along through all the successive
 variations in a representative body which biennial elections would
 naturally produce in both houses is it presumable that every man
 the instant he took his seat in the national senate or house of
 representatives would commence a traitor to his constituents and to
 his country can it be supposed that there would not be found one
 man discerning enough to detect so atrocious a conspiracy or bold
 or honest enough to apprise his constituents of their danger if
 such presumptions can fairly be made there ought at once to be an
 end of all delegated authority the people should resolve to recall
 all the powers they have heretofore parted with out of their own
 hands and to divide themselves into as many states as there are
 counties in order that they may be able to manage their own
 concerns in person
if such suppositions could even be reasonably made still the
 concealment of the design for any duration would be impracticable
 it would be announced by the very circumstance of augmenting the
 army to so great an extent in time of profound peace what
 colorable reason could be assigned in a country so situated for
 such vast augmentations of the military force it is impossible
 that the people could be long deceived and the destruction of the
 project and of the projectors would quickly follow the discovery
it has been said that the provision which limits the
 appropriation of money for the support of an army to the period of
 two years would be unavailing because the executive when once
 possessed of a force large enough to awe the people into submission
 would find resources in that very force sufficient to enable him to
 dispense with supplies from the acts of the legislature but the
 question again recurs upon what pretense could he be put in
 possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace if we
 suppose it to have been created in consequence of some domestic
 insurrection or foreign war then it becomes a case not within the
 principles of the objection for this is levelled against the power
 of keeping up troops in time of peace few persons will be so
 visionary as seriously to contend that military forces ought not to
 be raised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion and if the
 defense of the community under such circumstances should make it
 necessary to have an army so numerous as to hazard its liberty this
 is one of those calamaties for which there is neither preventative
 nor cure it cannot be provided against by any possible form of
 government it might even result from a simple league offensive and
 defensive if it should ever be necessary for the confederates or
 allies to form an army for common defense
but it is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a
 united than in a disunited state nay it may be safely asserted
 that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter
 situation it is not easy to conceive a possibility that dangers so
 formidable can assail the whole union as to demand a force
 considerable enough to place our liberties in the least jeopardy
 especially if we take into our view the aid to be derived from the
 militia which ought always to be counted upon as a valuable and
 powerful auxiliary but in a state of disunion as has been fully
 shown in another place the contrary of this supposition would
 become not only probable but almost unavoidable
publius

the same subject continued
the idea of restraining the legislative authority in regard to
 the common defense considered
from the new york packet
tuesday december  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
it has been urged in different shapes that a constitution of
 the kind proposed by the convention cannot operate without the aid
 of a military force to execute its laws this however like most
 other things that have been alleged on that side rests on mere
 general assertion unsupported by any precise or intelligible
 designation of the reasons upon which it is founded as far as i
 have been able to divine the latent meaning of the objectors it
 seems to originate in a presupposition that the people will be
 disinclined to the exercise of federal authority in any matter of an
 internal nature waiving any exception that might be taken to the
 inaccuracy or inexplicitness of the distinction between internal and
 external let us inquire what ground there is to presuppose that
 disinclination in the people unless we presume at the same time
 that the powers of the general government will be worse administered
 than those of the state government there seems to be no room for
 the presumption of illwill disaffection or opposition in the
 people i believe it may be laid down as a general rule that their
 confidence in and obedience to a government will commonly be
 proportioned to the goodness or badness of its administration it
 must be admitted that there are exceptions to this rule but these
 exceptions depend so entirely on accidental causes that they cannot
 be considered as having any relation to the intrinsic merits or
 demerits of a constitution these can only be judged of by general
 principles and maxims
various reasons have been suggested in the course of these
 papers to induce a probability that the general government will be
 better administered than the particular governments the principal
 of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres of election
 will present a greater option or latitude of choice to the people
 that through the medium of the state legislatures which are select
 bodies of men and which are to appoint the members of the national
 senate there is reason to expect that this branch will generally be
 composed with peculiar care and judgment that these circumstances
 promise greater knowledge and more extensive information in the
 national councils and that they will be less apt to be tainted by
 the spirit of faction and more out of the reach of those occasional
 illhumors or temporary prejudices and propensities which in
 smaller societies frequently contaminate the public councils beget
 injustice and oppression of a part of the community and engender
 schemes which though they gratify a momentary inclination or
 desire terminate in general distress dissatisfaction and disgust
 several additional reasons of considerable force to fortify that
 probability will occur when we come to survey with a more critical
 eye the interior structure of the edifice which we are invited to
 erect it will be sufficient here to remark that until
 satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an opinion that the
 federal government is likely to be administered in such a manner as
 to render it odious or contemptible to the people there can be no
 reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws of the union
 will meet with any greater obstruction from them or will stand in
 need of any other methods to enforce their execution than the laws
 of the particular members
the hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition the
 dread of punishment a proportionably strong discouragement to it
 will not the government of the union which if possessed of a due
 degree of power can call to its aid the collective resources of the
 whole confederacy be more likely to repress the former sentiment
 and to inspire the latter than that of a single state which can
 only command the resources within itself a turbulent faction in a
 state may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends to
 the government in that state but it can hardly be so infatuated as
 to imagine itself a match for the combined efforts of the union if
 this reflection be just there is less danger of resistance from
 irregular combinations of individuals to the authority of the
 confederacy than to that of a single member
i will in this place hazard an observation which will not be
 the less just because to some it may appear new which is that the
 more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in
 the ordinary exercise of government the more the citizens are
 accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their
 political life the more it is familiarized to their sight and to
 their feelings the further it enters into those objects which touch
 the most sensible chords and put in motion the most active springs
 of the human heart the greater will be the probability that it will
 conciliate the respect and attachment of the community man is very
 much a creature of habit a thing that rarely strikes his senses
 will generally have but little influence upon his mind a
 government continually at a distance and out of sight can hardly be
 expected to interest the sensations of the people the inference
 is that the authority of the union and the affections of the
 citizens towards it will be strengthened rather than weakened by
 its extension to what are called matters of internal concern and
 will have less occasion to recur to force in proportion to the
 familiarity and comprehensiveness of its agency the more it
 circulates through those channls and currents in which the passions
 of mankind naturally flow the less will it require the aid of the
 violent and perilous expedients of compulsion
one thing at all events must be evident that a government
 like the one proposed would bid much fairer to avoid the necessity
 of using force than that species of league contend for by most of
 its opponents the authority of which should only operate upon the
 states in their political or collective capacities it has been
 shown that in such a confederacy there can be no sanction for the
 laws but force that frequent delinquencies in the members are the
 natural offspring of the very frame of the government and that as
 often as these happen they can only be redressed if at all by war
 and violence
the plan reported by the convention by extending the authority
 of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several
 states will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy
 of each in the execution of its laws it is easy to perceive that
 this will tend to destroy in the common apprehension all
 distinction between the sources from which they might proceed and
 will give the federal government the same advantage for securing a
 due obedience to its authority which is enjoyed by the government of
 each state in addition to the influence on public opinion which
 will result from the important consideration of its having power to
 call to its assistance and support the resources of the whole union
 it merits particular attention in this place that the laws of the
 confederacy as to the enumerated and legitimate objects of its
 jurisdiction will become the supreme law of the land to the
 observance of which all officers legislative executive and
 judicial in each state will be bound by the sanctity of an oath
 thus the legislatures courts and magistrates of the respective
 members will be incorporated into the operations of the national
 government as far as its just and constitutional authority extends
 and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws 
 any man who will pursue by his own reflections the consequences
 of this situation will perceive that there is good ground to
 calculate upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the
 union if its powers are administered with a common share of
 prudence if we will arbitrarily suppose the contrary we may
 deduce any inferences we please from the supposition for it is
 certainly possible by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of
 the best government that ever was or ever can be instituted to
 provoke and precipitate the people into the wildest excesses but
 though the adversaries of the proposed constitution should presume
 that the national rulers would be insensible to the motives of
 public good or to the obligations of duty i would still ask them
 how the interests of ambition or the views of encroachment can be
 promoted by such a conduct
publius
fna the sophistry which has been employed to show that this will
 tend to the destruction of the state governments will in its will
 in its proper place be fully detected
federalist no 
the same subject continued
the idea of restraining the legislative authority in regard to
 the common defense considered
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
that there may happen cases in which the national government may
 be necessitated to resort to force cannot be denied our own
 experience has corroborated the lessons taught by the examples of
 other nations that emergencies of this sort will sometimes arise
 in all societies however constituted that seditions and
 insurrections are unhappily maladies as inseparable from the body
 politic as tumors and eruptions from the natural body that the
 idea of governing at all times by the simple force of law which we
 have been told is the only admissible principle of republican
 government has no place but in the reveries of those political
 doctors whose sagacity disdains the admonitions of experimental
 instruction
should such emergencies at any time happen under the national
 government there could be no remedy but force the means to be
 employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief if it
 should be a slight commotion in a small part of a state the militia
 of the residue would be adequate to its suppression and the
 national presumption is that they would be ready to do their duty
 an insurrection whatever may be its immediate cause eventually
 endangers all government regard to the public peace if not to the
 rights of the union would engage the citizens to whom the contagion
 had not communicated itself to oppose the insurgents and if the
 general government should be found in practice conducive to the
 prosperity and felicity of the people it were irrational to believe
 that they would be disinclined to its support
if on the contrary the insurrection should pervade a whole
 state or a principal part of it the employment of a different kind
 of force might become unavoidable it appears that massachusetts
 found it necessary to raise troops for repressing the disorders
 within that state that pennsylvania from the mere apprehension of
 commotions among a part of her citizens has thought proper to have
 recourse to the same measure suppose the state of new york had
 been inclined to reestablish her lost jurisdiction over the
 inhabitants of vermont could she have hoped for success in such an
 enterprise from the efforts of the militia alone would she not
 have been compelled to raise and to maintain a more regular force
 for the execution of her design if it must then be admitted that
 the necessity of recurring to a force different from the militia in
 cases of this extraordinary nature is applicable to the state
 governments themselves why should the possibility that the
 national government might be under a like necessity in similar
 extremities be made an objection to its existence is it not
 surprising that men who declare an attachment to the union in the
 abstract should urge as an objection to the proposed constitution
 what applies with tenfold weight to the plan for which they contend
 and what as far as it has any foundation in truth is an
 inevitable consequence of civil society upon an enlarged scale who
 would not prefer that possibility to the unceasing agitations and
 frequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty
 republics
let us pursue this examination in another light suppose in
 lieu of one general system two or three or even four
 confederacies were to be formed would not the same difficulty
 oppose itself to the operations of either of these confederacies
 would not each of them be exposed to the same casualties and when
 these happened be obliged to have recourse to the same expedients
 for upholding its authority which are objected to in a government
 for all the states would the militia in this supposition be more
 ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case
 of a general union all candid and intelligent men must upon due
 consideration acknowledge that the principle of the objection is
 equally applicable to either of the two cases and that whether we
 have one government for all the states or different governments for
 different parcels of them or even if there should be an entire
 separation of the states there might sometimes be a necessity to
 make use of a force constituted differently from the militia to
 preserve the peace of the community and to maintain the just
 authority of the laws against those violent invasions of them which
 amount to insurrections and rebellions
independent of all other reasonings upon the subject it is a
 full answer to those who require a more peremptory provision against
 military establishments in time of peace to say that the whole
 power of the proposed government is to be in the hands of the
 representatives of the people this is the essential and after
 all only efficacious security for the rights and privileges of the
 people which is attainable in civil society 
if the representatives of the people betray their constituents
 there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original
 right of selfdefense which is paramount to all positive forms of
 government and which against the usurpations of the national
 rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success
 than against those of the rulers of an individual state in a
 single state if the persons intrusted with supreme power become
 usurpers the different parcels subdivisions or districts of which
 it consists having no distinct government in each can take no
 regular measures for defense the citizens must rush tumultuously
 to arms without concert without system without resource except
 in their courage and despair the usurpers clothed with the forms
 of legal authority can too often crush the opposition in embryo
 the smaller the extent of the territory the more difficult will it
 be for the people to form a regular or systematic plan of
 opposition and the more easy will it be to defeat their early
 efforts intelligence can be more speedily obtained of their
 preparations and movements and the military force in the possession
 of the usurpers can be more rapidly directed against the part where
 the opposition has begun in this situation there must be a
 peculiar coincidence of circumstances to insure success to the
 popular resistance
the obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance
 increase with the increased extent of the state provided the
 citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them
 the natural strength of the people in a large community in
 proportion to the artificial strength of the government is greater
 than in a small and of course more competent to a struggle with the
 attempts of the government to establish a tyranny but in a
 confederacy the people without exaggeration may be said to be
 entirely the masters of their own fate power being almost always
 the rival of power the general government will at all times stand
 ready to check the usurpations of the state governments and these
 will have the same disposition towards the general government the
 people by throwing themselves into either scale will infallibly
 make it preponderate if their rights are invaded by either they
 can make use of the other as the instrument of redress how wise
 will it be in them by cherishing the union to preserve to themselves
 an advantage which can never be too highly prized
it may safely be received as an axiom in our political system
 that the state governments will in all possible contingencies
 afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by
 the national authority projects of usurpation cannot be masked
 under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies
 of men as of the people at large the legislatures will have
 better means of information they can discover the danger at a
 distance and possessing all the organs of civil power and the
 confidence of the people they can at once adopt a regular plan of
 opposition in which they can combine all the resources of the
 community they can readily communicate with each other in the
 different states and unite their common forces for the protection
 of their common liberty
the great extent of the country is a further security we have
 already experienced its utility against the attacks of a foreign
 power and it would have precisely the same effect against the
 enterprises of ambitious rulers in the national councils if the
 federal army should be able to quell the resistance of one state
 the distant states would have it in their power to make head with
 fresh forces the advantages obtained in one place must be
 abandoned to subdue the opposition in others and the moment the
 part which had been reduced to submission was left to itself its
 efforts would be renewed and its resistance revive
we should recollect that the extent of the military force must
 at all events be regulated by the resources of the country for a
 long time to come it will not be possible to maintain a large army
 and as the means of doing this increase the population and natural
 strength of the community will proportionably increase when will
 the time arrive that the federal government can raise and maintain
 an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the
 people of an immense empire who are in a situation through the
 medium of their state governments to take measures for their own
 defense with all the celerity regularity and system of

concerning the militia
from the daily advertiser
thursday january

to the people of the state of new york
the power of regulating the militia and of commanding its
 services in times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents
 to the duties of superintending the common defense and of watching
 over the internal peace of the confederacy
it requires no skill in the science of war to discern that
 uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would
 be attended with the most beneficial effects whenever they were
 called into service for the public defense it would enable them to
 discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual
 intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the
 operations of an army and it would fit them much sooner to acquire
 the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be
 essential to their usefulness this desirable uniformity can only
 be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the
 direction of the national authority it is therefore with the
 most evident propriety that the plan of the convention proposes to
 empower the union to provide for organizing arming and
 disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may
 be employed in the service of the united states reserving to the
 states respectively the appointment of the officers and the
 authority of training the militia according to the discipline
 prescribed by congress
of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to
 the plan of the convention there is none that was so little to have
 been expected or is so untenable in itself as the one from which
 this particular provision has been attacked if a wellregulated
 militia be the most natural defense of a free country it ought
 certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that
 body which is constituted the guardian of the national security if
 standing armies are dangerous to liberty an efficacious power over
 the militia in the body to whose care the protection of the state
 is committed ought as far as possible to take away the inducement
 and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions if the federal
 government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies
 which call for the military arm in support of the civil magistrate
 it can the better dispense with the employment of a different kind
 of force if it cannot avail itself of the former it will be
 obliged to recur to the latter to render an army unnecessary will
 be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand
 prohibitions upon paper
in order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the
 militia to execute the laws of the union it has been remarked that
 there is nowhere any provision in the proposed constitution for
 calling out the posse comitatus to assist the magistrate in the
 execution of his duty whence it has been inferred that military
 force was intended to be his only auxiliary there is a striking
 incoherence in the objections which have appeared and sometimes
 even from the same quarter not much calculated to inspire a very
 favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair dealing of their authors
 the same persons who tell us in one breath that the powers of the
 federal government will be despotic and unlimited inform us in the
 next that it has not authority sufficient even to call out the
 posse comitatus the latter fortunately is as much short of the
 truth as the former exceeds it it would be as absurd to doubt
 that a right to pass all laws necessary and proper to execute its
 declared powers would include that of requiring the assistance of
 the citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution
 of those laws as it would be to believe that a right to enact laws
 necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes
 would involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the
 alienation of landed property or of abolishing the trial by jury in
 cases relating to it it being therefore evident that the
 supposition of a want of power to require the aid of the posse
 comitatus is entirely destitute of color it will follow that the
 conclusion which has been drawn from it in its application to the
 authority of the federal government over the militia is as uncandid
 as it is illogical what reason could there be to infer that force
 was intended to be the sole instrument of authority merely because
 there is a power to make use of it when necessary what shall we
 think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in
 this manner how shall we prevent a conflict between charity and
 judgment
by a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy
 we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself in
 the hands of the federal government it is observed that select
 corps may be formed composed of the young and ardent who may be
 rendered subservient to the views of arbitrary power what plan for
 the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national
 government is impossible to be foreseen but so far from viewing
 the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps
 as dangerous were the constitution ratified and were i to deliver
 my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature from this state
 on the subject of a militia establishment i should hold to him in
 substance the following discourse
the project of disciplining all the militia of the united
 states is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of
 being carried into execution a tolerable expertness in military
 movements is a business that requires time and practice it is not
 a day or even a week that will suffice for the attainment of it
 to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes
 of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through
 military exercises and evolutions as often as might be necessary to
 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the
 character of a wellregulated militia would be a real grievance to
 the people and a serious public inconvenience and loss it would
 form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country
 to an amount which calculating upon the present numbers of the
 people would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil
 establishments of all the states to attempt a thing which would
 abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent
 would be unwise and the experiment if made could not succeed
 because it would not long be endured little more can reasonably be
 aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them
 properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not
 neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in
 the course of a year
but though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be
 abandoned as mischievous or impracticable yet it is a matter of
 the utmost importance that a welldigested plan should as soon as
 possible be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia
 the attention of the government ought particularly to be directed
 to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent upon such
 principles as will really fit them for service in case of need by
 thus circumscribing the plan it will be possible to have an
 excellent body of welltrained militia ready to take the field
 whenever the defense of the state shall require it this will not
 only lessen the call for military establishments but if
 circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an
 army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the
 liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens
 little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of
 arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their
 fellowcitizens this appears to me the only substitute that can be
 devised for a standing army and the best possible security against
 it if it should exist
thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed
 constitution should i reason on the same subject deducing arguments
 of safety from the very sources which they represent as fraught with
 danger and perdition but how the national legislature may reason
 on the point is a thing which neither they nor i can foresee
there is something so farfetched and so extravagant in the idea
 of danger to liberty from the militia that one is at a loss whether
 to treat it with gravity or with raillery whether to consider it
 as a mere trial of skill like the paradoxes of rhetoricians as a
 disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price or as the
 serious offspring of political fanaticism where in the name of
 commonsense are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons our
 brothers our neighbors our fellowcitizens what shadow of danger
 can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their
 countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings
 sentiments habits and interests what reasonable cause of
 apprehension can be inferred from a power in the union to prescribe
 regulations for the militia and to command its services when
 necessary while the particular states are to have the sole and
 exclusive appointment of the officers if it were possible
 seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable
 establishment under the federal government the circumstance of the
 officers being in the appointment of the states ought at once to
 extinguish it there can be no doubt that this circumstance will
 always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia
in reading many of the publications against the constitution a
 man is apt to imagine that he is perusing some illwritten tale or
 romance which instead of natural and agreeable images exhibits to
 the mind nothing but frightful and distorted shapes gorgons hydras
 and chimeras dire discoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents
 and transforming everything it touches into a monster
a sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and
 improbable suggestions which have taken place respecting the power
 of calling for the services of the militia that of new hampshire
 is to be marched to georgia of georgia to new hampshire of new
 york to kentucky and of kentucky to lake champlain nay the debts
 due to the french and dutch are to be paid in militiamen instead of
 louis dors and ducats at one moment there is to be a large army
 to lay prostrate the liberties of the people at another moment the
 militia of virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or six
 hundred miles to tame the republican contumacy of massachusetts
 and that of massachusetts is to be transported an equal distance to
 subdue the refractory haughtiness of the aristocratic virginians
 do the persons who rave at this rate imagine that their art or
 their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon the
 people of america for infallible truths
if there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of
 despotism what need of the militia if there should be no army
 whither would the militia irritated by being called upon to
 undertake a distant and hopeless expedition for the purpose of
 riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen
 direct their course but to the seat of the tyrants who had
 meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project to crush them
 in their imagined intrenchments of power and to make them an
 example of the just vengeance of an abused and incensed people is
 this the way in which usurpers stride to dominion over a numerous
 and enlightened nation do they begin by exciting the detestation
 of the very instruments of their intended usurpations do they
 usually commence their career by wanton and disgustful acts of
 power calculated to answer no end but to draw upon themselves
 universal hatred and execration are suppositions of this sort the
 sober admonitions of discerning patriots to a discerning people or
 are they the inflammatory ravings of incendiaries or distempered
 enthusiasts if we were even to suppose the national rulers
 actuated by the most ungovernable ambition it is impossible to
 believe that they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish
 their designs
in times of insurrection or invasion it would be natural and
 proper that the militia of a neighboring state should be marched
 into another to resist a common enemy or to guard the republic
 against the violence of faction or sedition this was frequently
 the case in respect to the first object in the course of the late
 war and this mutual succor is indeed a principal end of our
 political association if the power of affording it be placed under
 the direction of the union there will be no danger of a supine and
 listless inattention to the dangers of a neighbor till its near
 approach had superadded the incitements of selfpreservation to the
 too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy

concerning the general power of taxation
from the new york packet
friday december  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
it has been already observed that the federal government ought
 to possess the power of providing for the support of the national
 forces in which proposition was intended to be included the
 expense of raising troops of building and equipping fleets and all
 other expenses in any wise connected with military arrangements and
 operations but these are not the only objects to which the
 jurisdiction of the union in respect to revenue must necessarily
 be empowered to extend it must embrace a provision for the support
 of the national civil list for the payment of the national debts
 contracted or that may be contracted and in general for all
 those matters which will call for disbursements out of the national
 treasury the conclusion is that there must be interwoven in the
 frame of the government a general power of taxation in one shape
 or another
money is with propriety considered as the vital principle of
 the body politic as that which sustains its life and motion and
 enables it to perform its most essential functions a complete
 power therefore to procure a regular and adequate supply of it as
 far as the resources of the community will permit may be regarded
 as an indispensable ingredient in every constitution from a
 deficiency in this particular one of two evils must ensue either
 the people must be subjected to continual plunder as a substitute
 for a more eligible mode of supplying the public wants or the
 government must sink into a fatal atrophy and in a short course of
 time perish
in the ottoman or turkish empire the sovereign though in other
 respects absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects
 has no right to impose a new tax the consequence is that he
 permits the bashaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people
 without mercy and in turn squeezes out of them the sums of which
 he stands in need to satisfy his own exigencies and those of the
 state in america from a like cause the government of the union
 has gradually dwindled into a state of decay approaching nearly to
 annihilation who can doubt that the happiness of the people in
 both countries would be promoted by competent authorities in the
 proper hands to provide the revenues which the necessities of the
 public might require
the present confederation feeble as it is intended to repose in
 the united states an unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary
 wants of the union but proceeding upon an erroneous principle it
 has been done in such a manner as entirely to have frustrated the
 intention congress by the articles which compose that compact as
 has already been stated are authorized to ascertain and call for
 any sums of money necessary in their judgment to the service of
 the united states and their requisitions if conformable to the
 rule of apportionment are in every constitutional sense obligatory
 upon the states these have no right to question the propriety of
 the demand no discretion beyond that of devising the ways and
 means of furnishing the sums demanded but though this be strictly
 and truly the case though the assumption of such a right would be
 an infringement of the articles of union though it may seldom or
 never have been avowedly claimed yet in practice it has been
 constantly exercised and would continue to be so as long as the
 revenues of the confederacy should remain dependent on the
 intermediate agency of its members what the consequences of this
 system have been is within the knowledge of every man the least
 conversant in our public affairs and has been amply unfolded in
 different parts of these inquiries it is this which has chiefly
 contributed to reduce us to a situation which affords ample cause
 both of mortification to ourselves and of triumph to our enemies
what remedy can there be for this situation but in a change of
 the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and
 delusive system of quotas and requisitions what substitute can
 there be imagined for this ignis fatuus in finance but that of
 permitting the national government to raise its own revenues by the
 ordinary methods of taxation authorized in every wellordered
 constitution of civil government ingenious men may declaim with
 plausibility on any subject but no human ingenuity can point out
 any other expedient to rescue us from the inconveniences and
 embarrassments naturally resulting from defective supplies of the
 public treasury
the more intelligent adversaries of the new constitution admit
 the force of this reasoning but they qualify their admission by a
 distinction between what they call internal and external taxation
 the former they would reserve to the state governments the
 latter which they explain into commercial imposts or rather duties
 on imported articles they declare themselves willing to concede to
 the federal head this distinction however would violate the
 maxim of good sense and sound policy which dictates that every
 power ought to be in proportion to its object and would still
 leave the general government in a kind of tutelage to the state
 governments inconsistent with every idea of vigor or efficiency
 who can pretend that commercial imposts are or would be alone
 equal to the present and future exigencies of the union taking
 into the account the existing debt foreign and domestic upon any
 plan of extinguishment which a man moderately impressed with the
 importance of public justice and public credit could approve in
 addition to the establishments which all parties will acknowledge to
 be necessary we could not reasonably flatter ourselves that this
 resource alone upon the most improved scale would even suffice for
 its present necessities its future necessities admit not of
 calculation or limitation and upon the principle more than once
 adverted to the power of making provision for them as they arise
 ought to be equally unconfined i believe it may be regarded as a
 position warranted by the history of mankind that in the usual
 progress of things the necessities of a nation in every stage of
 its existence will be found at least equal to its resources
to say that deficiencies may be provided for by requisitions
 upon the states is on the one hand to acknowledge that this system
 cannot be depended upon and on the other hand to depend upon it for
 every thing beyond a certain limit those who have carefully
 attended to its vices and deformities as they have been exhibited by
 experience or delineated in the course of these papers must feel
 invincible repugnancy to trusting the national interests in any
 degree to its operation its inevitable tendency whenever it is
 brought into activity must be to enfeeble the union and sow the
 seeds of discord and contention between the federal head and its
 members and between the members themselves can it be expected
 that the deficiencies would be better supplied in this mode than the
 total wants of the union have heretofore been supplied in the same
 mode it ought to be recollected that if less will be required from
 the states they will have proportionably less means to answer the
 demand if the opinions of those who contend for the distinction
 which has been mentioned were to be received as evidence of truth
 one would be led to conclude that there was some known point in the
 economy of national affairs at which it would be safe to stop and to
 say thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by
 supplying the wants of government and all beyond this is unworthy
 of our care or anxiety how is it possible that a government half
 supplied and always necessitous can fulfill the purposes of its
 institution can provide for the security advance the prosperity
 or support the reputation of the commonwealth how can it ever
 possess either energy or stability dignity or credit confidence at
 home or respectability abroad how can its administration be any
 thing else than a succession of expedients temporizing impotent
 disgraceful how will it be able to avoid a frequent sacrifice of
 its engagements to immediate necessity how can it undertake or
 execute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good
let us attend to what would be the effects of this situation in
 the very first war in which we should happen to be engaged we will
 presume for arguments sake that the revenue arising from the
 impost duties answers the purposes of a provision for the public
 debt and of a peace establishment for the union thus
 circumstanced a war breaks out what would be the probable conduct
 of the government in such an emergency taught by experience that
 proper dependence could not be placed on the success of
 requisitions unable by its own authority to lay hold of fresh
 resources and urged by considerations of national danger would it
 not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already
 appropriated from their proper objects to the defense of the state
 it is not easy to see how a step of this kind could be avoided
 and if it should be taken it is evident that it would prove the
 destruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming
 essential to the public safety to imagine that at such a crisis
 credit might be dispensed with would be the extreme of infatuation
 in the modern system of war nations the most wealthy are obliged
 to have recourse to large loans a country so little opulent as
 ours must feel this necessity in a much stronger degree but who
 would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing
 by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the
 steadiness of its measures for paying the loans it might be able
 to procure would be as limited in their extent as burdensome in
 their conditions they would be made upon the same principles that
 usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors with a
 sparing hand and at enormous premiums
it may perhaps be imagined that from the scantiness of the
 resources of the country the necessity of diverting the established
 funds in the case supposed would exist though the national
 government should possess an unrestrained power of taxation but
 two considerations will serve to quiet all apprehension on this
 head one is that we are sure the resources of the community in
 their full extent will be brought into activity for the benefit of
 the union the other is that whatever deficiences there may be
 can without difficulty be supplied by loans
the power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation by
 its own authority would enable the national government to borrow as
 far as its necessities might require foreigners as well as the
 citizens of america could then reasonably repose confidence in its
 engagements but to depend upon a government that must itself
 depend upon thirteen other governments for the means of fulfilling
 its contracts when once its situation is clearly understood would
 require a degree of credulity not often to be met with in the
 pecuniary transactions of mankind and little reconcilable with the
 usual sharpsightedness of avarice
reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men who
 hope to see realized in america the halcyon scenes of the poetic or
 fabulous age but to those who believe we are likely to experience
 a common portion of the vicissitudes and calamities which have
 fallen to the lot of other nations they must appear entitled to
 serious attention such men must behold the actual situation of
 their country with painful solicitude and deprecate the evils which
 ambition or revenge might with too much facility inflict upon it

the same subject continued
concerning the general power of taxation
from the new york packet
tuesday january  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
in disquisitions of every kind there are certain primary
 truths or first principles upon which all subsequent reasonings
 must depend these contain an internal evidence which antecedent
 to all reflection or combination commands the assent of the mind
 where it produces not this effect it must proceed either from some
 defect or disorder in the organs of perception or from the
 influence of some strong interest or passion or prejudice of
 this nature are the maxims in geometry that the whole is greater
 than its part things equal to the same are equal to one another
 two straight lines cannot enclose a space and all right angles
 are equal to each other of the same nature are these other
 maxims in ethics and politics that there cannot be an effect
 without a cause that the means ought to be proportioned to the
 end that every power ought to be commensurate with its object
 that there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect
 a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation and there are
 other truths in the two latter sciences which if they cannot
 pretend to rank in the class of axioms are yet such direct
 inferences from them and so obvious in themselves and so agreeable
 to the natural and unsophisticated dictates of commonsense that
 they challenge the assent of a sound and unbiased mind with a
 degree of force and conviction almost equally irresistible
the objects of geometrical inquiry are so entirely abstracted
 from those pursuits which stir up and put in motion the unruly
 passions of the human heart that mankind without difficulty adopt
 not only the more simple theorems of the science but even those
 abstruse paradoxes which however they may appear susceptible of
 demonstration are at variance with the natural conceptions which
 the mind without the aid of philosophy would be led to entertain
 upon the subject the infinite divisibility of matter or in other
 words the infinite divisibility of a finite thing extending even
 to the minutest atom is a point agreed among geometricians though
 not less incomprehensible to commonsense than any of those
 mysteries in religion against which the batteries of infidelity
 have been so industriously leveled
but in the sciences of morals and politics men are found far
 less tractable to a certain degree it is right and useful that
 this should be the case caution and investigation are a necessary
 armor against error and imposition but this untractableness may be
 carried too far and may degenerate into obstinacy perverseness or
 disingenuity though it cannot be pretended that the principles of
 moral and political knowledge have in general the same degree of
 certainty with those of the mathematics yet they have much better
 claims in this respect than to judge from the conduct of men in
 particular situations we should be disposed to allow them the
 obscurity is much oftener in the passions and prejudices of the
 reasoner than in the subject men upon too many occasions do not
 give their own understandings fair play but yielding to some
 untoward bias they entangle themselves in words and confound
 themselves in subtleties
how else could it happen if we admit the objectors to be
 sincere in their opposition that positions so clear as those which
 manifest the necessity of a general power of taxation in the
 government of the union should have to encounter any adversaries
 among men of discernment though these positions have been
 elsewhere fully stated they will perhaps not be improperly
 recapitulated in this place as introductory to an examination of
 what may have been offered by way of objection to them they are in
 substance as follows
a government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to
 the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care and to
 the complete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible
 free from every other control but a regard to the public good and to
 the sense of the people
as the duties of superintending the national defense and of
 securing the public peace against foreign or domestic violence
 involve a provision for casualties and dangers to which no possible
 limits can be assigned the power of making that provision ought to
 know no other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the
 resources of the community
as revenue is the essential engine by which the means of
 answering the national exigencies must be procured the power of
 procuring that article in its full extent must necessarily be
 comprehended in that of providing for those exigencies
as theory and practice conspire to prove that the power of
 procuring revenue is unavailing when exercised over the states in
 their collective capacities the federal government must of
 necessity be invested with an unqualified power of taxation in the
 ordinary modes
did not experience evince the contrary it would be natural to
 conclude that the propriety of a general power of taxation in the
 national government might safely be permitted to rest on the
 evidence of these propositions unassisted by any additional
 arguments or illustrations but we find in fact that the
 antagonists of the proposed constitution so far from acquiescing in
 their justness or truth seem to make their principal and most
 zealous effort against this part of the plan it may therefore be
 satisfactory to analyze the arguments with which they combat it
those of them which have been most labored with that view seem
 in substance to amount to this it is not true because the
 exigencies of the union may not be susceptible of limitation that
 its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined revenue is as
 requisite to the purposes of the local administrations as to those
 of the union and the former are at least of equal importance with
 the latter to the happiness of the people it is therefore as
 necessary that the state governments should be able to command the
 means of supplying their wants as that the national government
 should possess the like faculty in respect to the wants of the union
 but an indefinite power of taxation in the latter might and
 probably would in time deprive the former of the means of providing
 for their own necessities and would subject them entirely to the
 mercy of the national legislature as the laws of the union are to
 become the supreme law of the land as it is to have power to pass
 all laws that may be necessary for carrying into execution the
 authorities with which it is proposed to vest it the national
 government might at any time abolish the taxes imposed for state
 objects upon the pretense of an interference with its own it might
 allege a necessity of doing this in order to give efficacy to the
 national revenues and thus all the resources of taxation might by
 degrees become the subjects of federal monopoly to the entire
 exclusion and destruction of the state governments
this mode of reasoning appears sometimes to turn upon the
 supposition of usurpation in the national government at other
 times it seems to be designed only as a deduction from the
 constitutional operation of its intended powers it is only in the
 latter light that it can be admitted to have any pretensions to
 fairness the moment we launch into conjectures about the
 usurpations of the federal government we get into an unfathomable
 abyss and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning
 imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst
 the labyrinths of an enchanted castle and knows not on which side
 to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has
 so rashly adventured whatever may be the limits or modifications
 of the powers of the union it is easy to imagine an endless train
 of possible dangers and by indulging an excess of jealousy and
 timidity we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism
 and irresolution i repeat here what i have observed in substance
 in another place that all observations founded upon the danger of
 usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of
 the government not to the nature or extent of its powers the
 state governments by their original constitutions are invested
 with complete sovereignty in what does our security consist
 against usurpation from that quarter doubtless in the manner of
 their formation and in a due dependence of those who are to
 administer them upon the people if the proposed construction of
 the federal government be found upon an impartial examination of
 it to be such as to afford to a proper extent the same species of
 security all apprehensions on the score of usurpation ought to be
 discarded
it should not be forgotten that a disposition in the state
 governments to encroach upon the rights of the union is quite as
 probable as a disposition in the union to encroach upon the rights
 of the state governments what side would be likely to prevail in
 such a conflict must depend on the means which the contending
 parties could employ toward insuring success as in republics
 strength is always on the side of the people and as there are
 weighty reasons to induce a belief that the state governments will
 commonly possess most influence over them the natural conclusion is
 that such contests will be most apt to end to the disadvantage of
 the union and that there is greater probability of encroachments
 by the members upon the federal head than by the federal head upon
 the members but it is evident that all conjectures of this kind
 must be extremely vague and fallible and that it is by far the
 safest course to lay them altogether aside and to confine our
 attention wholly to the nature and extent of the powers as they are
 delineated in the constitution every thing beyond this must be
 left to the prudence and firmness of the people who as they will
 hold the scales in their own hands it is to be hoped will always
 take care to preserve the constitutional equilibrium between the
 general and the state governments upon this ground which is
 evidently the true one it will not be difficult to obviate the
 objections which have been made to an indefinite power of taxation
 in the united states

although i am of opinion that there would be no real danger of
 the consequences which seem to be apprehended to the state
 governments from a power in the union to control them in the levies

 extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the state
 governments and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local
 administrations for local purposes would be a complete barrier
 against the oppressive use of such a power yet i am willing here
 to allow in its full extent the justness of the reasoning which
 requires that the individual states should possess an independent
 and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the
 supply of their own wants and making this concession i affirm
 that with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports they
 would under the plan of the convention retain that authority in
 the most absolute and unqualified sense and that an attempt on the
