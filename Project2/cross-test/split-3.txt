 part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of
 it would be a violent assumption of power unwarranted by any
 article or clause of its constitution
an entire consolidation of the states into one complete national
 sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the parts and
 whatever powers might remain in them would be altogether dependent
 on the general will but as the plan of the convention aims only at
 a partial union or consolidation the state governments would
 clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had
 and which were not by that act exclusively delegated to the united
 states this exclusive delegation or rather this alienation of
 state sovereignty would only exist in three cases where the
 constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the
 union where it granted in one instance an authority to the union
 and in another prohibited the states from exercising the like
 authority and where it granted an authority to the union to which
 a similar authority in the states would be absolutely and totally
 contradictory and repugnant i use these terms to distinguish this
 last case from another which might appear to resemble it but which
 would in fact be essentially different i mean where the exercise
 of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional
 interferences in the policy of any branch of administration but
 would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of
 constitutional authority these three cases of exclusive
 jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the
 following instances the last clause but one in the eighth section
 of the first article provides expressly that congress shall exercise
 exclusive legislation over the district to be appropriated as
 the seat of government this answers to the first case the first
 clause of the same section empowers congress to lay and collect
 taxes duties imposts and excises and the second clause of the
 tenth section of the same article declares that no state shall
 without the consent of congress lay any imposts or duties on
 imports or exports except for the purpose of executing its
 inspection laws hence would result an exclusive power in the
 union to lay duties on imports and exports with the particular
 exception mentioned but this power is abridged by another clause
 which declares that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles
 exported from any state in consequence of which qualification it
 now only extends to the duties on imports this answers to the
 second case the third will be found in that clause which declares
 that congress shall have power to establish an uniform rule of
 naturalization throughout the united states this must
 necessarily be exclusive because if each state had power to
 prescribe a distinct rule there could not be a uniform rule
a case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter but
 which is in fact widely different affects the question immediately
 under consideration i mean the power of imposing taxes on all
 articles other than exports and imports this i contend is
 manifestly a concurrent and coequal authority in the united states
 and in the individual states there is plainly no expression in the
 granting clause which makes that power exclusive in the union
 there is no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the
 states from exercising it so far is this from being the case that
 a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be deduced
 from the restraint laid upon the states in relation to duties on
 imports and exports this restriction implies an admission that if
 it were not inserted the states would possess the power it
 excludes and it implies a further admission that as to all other
 taxes the authority of the states remains undiminished in any
 other view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous it would be
 unnecessary because if the grant to the union of the power of
 laying such duties implied the exclusion of the states or even
 their subordination in this particular there could be no need of
 such a restriction it would be dangerous because the introduction
 of it leads directly to the conclusion which has been mentioned and
 which if the reasoning of the objectors be just could not have
 been intended i mean that the states in all cases to which the
 restriction did not apply would have a concurrent power of taxation
 with the union the restriction in question amounts to what lawyers
 call a negative pregnant that is a negation of one thing and an
 affirmance of another a negation of the authority of the states to
 impose taxes on imports and exports and an affirmance of their
 authority to impose them on all other articles it would be mere
 sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them absolutely from
 the imposition of taxes of the former kind and to leave them at
 liberty to lay others subject to the control of the national
 legislature the restraining or prohibitory clause only says that
 they shall not without the consent of congress lay such duties
 and if we are to understand this in the sense last mentioned the
 constitution would then be made to introduce a formal provision for
 the sake of a very absurd conclusion which is that the states
 with the consent of the national legislature might tax imports and
 exports and that they might tax every other article unless
 controlled by the same body if this was the intention why not
 leave it in the first instance to what is alleged to be the
 natural operation of the original clause conferring a general power
 of taxation upon the union it is evident that this could not have
 been the intention and that it will not bear a construction of the
 kind
as to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of taxation
 in the states and in the union it cannot be supported in that sense
 which would be requisite to work an exclusion of the states it is
 indeed possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by
 a state which might render it inexpedient that thus a further tax
 should be laid on the same article by the union but it would not
 imply a constitutional inability to impose a further tax the
 quantity of the imposition the expediency or inexpediency of an
 increase on either side would be mutually questions of prudence
 but there would be involved no direct contradiction of power the
 particular policy of the national and of the state systems of
 finance might now and then not exactly coincide and might require
 reciprocal forbearances it is not however a mere possibility of
 inconvenience in the exercise of powers but an immediate
 constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and
 extinguish a preexisting right of sovereignty
the necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases
 results from the division of the sovereign power and the rule that
 all authorities of which the states are not explicitly divested in
 favor of the union remain with them in full vigor is not a
 theoretical consequence of that division but is clearly admitted by
 the whole tenor of the instrument which contains the articles of the
 proposed constitution we there find that notwithstanding the
 affirmative grants of general authorities there has been the most
 pointed care in those cases where it was deemed improper that the
 like authorities should reside in the states to insert negative
 clauses prohibiting the exercise of them by the states the tenth
 section of the first article consists altogether of such provisions
 this circumstance is a clear indication of the sense of the
 convention and furnishes a rule of interpretation out of the body
 of the act which justifies the position i have advanced and refutes
 every hypothesis to the contrary

the same subject continued
concerning the general power of taxation
from the daily advertiser
january  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the residue of the argument against the provisions of the
 constitution in respect to taxation is ingrafted upon the following
 clause the last clause of the eighth section of the first article
 of the plan under consideration authorizes the national legislature
 to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying
 into execution the powers by that constitution vested in the
 government of the united states or in any department or officer
 thereof and the second clause of the sixth article declares
 that the constitution and the laws of the united states made in
 pursuance thereof and the treaties made by their authority shall be
 the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws
 of any state to the contrary notwithstanding
these two clauses have been the source of much virulent
 invective and petulant declamation against the proposed constitution
 they have been held up to the people in all the exaggerated colors
 of misrepresentation as the pernicious engines by which their local
 governments were to be destroyed and their liberties exterminated
 as the hideous monster whose devouring jaws would spare neither sex
 nor age nor high nor low nor sacred nor profane and yet strange
 as it may appear after all this clamor to those who may not have
 happened to contemplate them in the same light it may be affirmed
 with perfect confidence that the constitutional operation of the
 intended government would be precisely the same if these clauses
 were entirely obliterated as if they were repeated in every article
 they are only declaratory of a truth which would have resulted by
 necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of
 constituting a federal government and vesting it with certain
 specified powers this is so clear a proposition that moderation
 itself can scarcely listen to the railings which have been so
 copiously vented against this part of the plan without emotions
 that disturb its equanimity
what is a power but the ability or faculty of doing a thing
 what is the ability to do a thing but the power of employing the
 means necessary to its execution what is a legislative power but
 a power of making laws what are the means to execute a legislative
 power but laws what is the power of laying and collecting taxes
 but a legislative power or a power of making laws to lay and
 collect taxes what are the propermeans of executing such a power
 but necessary and proper laws
this simple train of inquiry furnishes us at once with a test by
 which to judge of the true nature of the clause complained of it
 conducts us to this palpable truth that a power to lay and collect
 taxes must be a power to pass all laws necessary and proper for the
 execution of that power and what does the unfortunate and
 culumniated provision in question do more than declare the same
 truth to wit that the national legislature to whom the power of
 laying and collecting taxes had been previously given might in the
 execution of that power pass all laws necessary and proper to carry
 it into effect i have applied these observations thus particularly
 to the power of taxation because it is the immediate subject under
 consideration and because it is the most important of the
 authorities proposed to be conferred upon the union but the same
 process will lead to the same result in relation to all other
 powers declared in the constitution and it is expressly to execute
 these powers that the sweeping clause as it has been affectedly
 called authorizes the national legislature to pass all necessary
 and proper laws if there is any thing exceptionable it must be
 sought for in the specific powers upon which this general
 declaration is predicated the declaration itself though it may be
 chargeable with tautology or redundancy is at least perfectly
 harmless
but suspicion may ask why then was it introduced the answer
 is that it could only have been done for greater caution and to
 guard against all cavilling refinements in those who might hereafter
 feel a disposition to curtail and evade the legitimatb authorities
 of the union the convention probably foresaw what it has been a
 principal aim of these papers to inculcate that the danger which
 most threatens our political welfare is that the state governments
 will finally sap the foundations of the union and might therefore
 think it necessary in so cardinal a point to leave nothing to
 construction whatever may have been the inducement to it the
 wisdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been
 raised against it as that very cry betrays a disposition to
 question the great and essential truth which it is manifestly the
 object of that provision to declare
but it may be again asked who is to judge of the necessity and
 propriety of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the
 union i answer first that this question arises as well and as
 fully upon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory
 clause and i answer in the second place that the national
 government like every other must judge in the first instance of
 the proper exercise of its powers and its constituents in the last
 if the federal government should overpass the just bounds of its
 authority and make a tyrannical use of its powers the people whose
 creature it is must appeal to the standard they have formed and
 take such measures to redress the injury done to the constitution as
 the exigency may suggest and prudence justify the propriety of a
 law in a constitutional light must always be determined by the
 nature of the powers upon which it is founded suppose by some
 forced constructions of its authority which indeed cannot easily
 be imagined the federal legislature should attempt to vary the law
 of descent in any state would it not be evident that in making
 such an attempt it had exceeded its jurisdiction and infringed
 upon that of the state suppose again that upon the pretense of
 an interference with its revenues it should undertake to abrogate a
 landtax imposed by the authority of a state would it not be
 equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent
 jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which its
 constitution plainly supposes to exist in the state governments if
 there ever should be a doubt on this head the credit of it will be
 entirely due to those reasoners who in the imprudent zeal of their
 animosity to the plan of the convention have labored to envelop it
 in a cloud calculated to obscure the plainest and simplest truths
but it is said that the laws of the union are to be the supreme
 law of the land but what inference can be drawn from this or what
 would they amount to if they were not to be supreme it is evident
 they would amount to nothing a law by the very meaning of the
 term includes supremacy it is a rule which those to whom it is
 prescribed are bound to observe this results from every political
 association if individuals enter into a state of society the laws
 of that society must be the supreme regulator of their conduct if
 a number of political societies enter into a larger political
 society the laws which the latter may enact pursuant to the powers
 intrusted to it by its constitution must necessarily be supreme
 over those societies and the individuals of whom they are composed
 it would otherwise be a mere treaty dependent on the good faith of
 the parties and not a goverment which is only another word for
 political power and supremacy but it will not follow from this
 doctrine that acts of the large society which are not pursuant to
 its constitutional powers but which are invasions of the residuary
 authorities of the smaller societies will become the supreme law of
 the land these will be merely acts of usurpation and will deserve
 to be treated as such hence we perceive that the clause which
 declares the supremacy of the laws of the union like the one we
 have just before considered only declares a truth which flows
 immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal
 government it will not i presume have escaped observation that
 it expressly confines this supremacy to laws made pursuant to the
 constitution which i mention merely as an instance of caution in
 the convention since that limitation would have been to be
 understood though it had not been expressed
though a law therefore laying a tax for the use of the united
 states would be supreme in its nature and could not legally be
 opposed or controlled yet a law for abrogating or preventing the
 collection of a tax laid by the authority of the state unless upon
 imports and exports would not be the supreme law of the land but
 a usurpation of power not granted by the constitution as far as an
 improper accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to
 render the collection difficult or precarious this would be a
 mutual inconvenience not arising from a superiority or defect of
 power on either side but from an injudicious exercise of power by
 one or the other in a manner equally disadvantageous to both it
 is to be hoped and presumed however that mutual interest would
 dictate a concert in this respect which would avoid any material
 inconvenience the inference from the whole is that the individual
 states would under the proposed constitution retain an independent
 and uncontrollable authority to raise revenue to any extent of which
 they may stand in need by every kind of taxation except duties on
 imports and exports it will be shown in the next paper that this
 concurrent jurisdiction in the article of taxation was the only
 admissible substitute for an entire subordination in respect to
 this branch of power of the state authority to that of the union
publius
federalist no 
the same subject continued
concerning the general power of taxation
from the new york packet
friday january  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
i flatter myself it has been clearly shown in my last number
 that the particular states under the proposed constitution would
 have coequal authority with the union in the article of revenue
 except as to duties on imports as this leaves open to the states
 far the greatest part of the resources of the community there can
 be no color for the assertion that they would not possess means as
 abundant as could be desired for the supply of their own wants
 independent of all external control that the field is sufficiently
 wide will more fully appear when we come to advert to the
 inconsiderable share of the public expenses for which it will fall
 to the lot of the state governments to provide
to argue upon abstract principles that this coordinate
 authority cannot exist is to set up supposition and theory against
 fact and reality however proper such reasonings might be to show
 that a thing ought not to exist they are wholly to be rejected when
 they are made use of to prove that it does not exist contrary to the
 evidence of the fact itself it is well known that in the roman
 republic the legislative authority in the last resort resided for
 ages in two different political bodies not as branches of the same
 legislature but as distinct and independent legislatures in each
 of which an opposite interest prevailed in one the patrician in
 the other the plebian many arguments might have been adduced to
 prove the unfitness of two such seemingly contradictory authorities
 each having power to annul or repeal the acts of the other but a
 man would have been regarded as frantic who should have attempted at
 rome to disprove their existence it will be readily understood
 that i allude to the comitia centuriata and the comitia tributa
 the former in which the people voted by centuries was so arranged
 as to give a superiority to the patrician interest in the latter
 in which numbers prevailed the plebian interest had an entire
 predominancy and yet these two legislatures coexisted for ages
 and the roman republic attained to the utmost height of human
 greatness
in the case particularly under consideration there is no such
 contradiction as appears in the example cited there is no power on
 either side to annul the acts of the other and in practice there
 is little reason to apprehend any inconvenience because in a
 short course of time the wants of the states will naturally reduce
 themselves within a very narrow compass and in the interim the
 united states will in all probability find it convenient to
 abstain wholly from those objects to which the particular states
 would be inclined to resort
to form a more precise judgment of the true merits of this
 question it will be well to advert to the proportion between the
 objects that will require a federal provision in respect to revenue
 and those which will require a state provision we shall discover
 that the former are altogether unlimited and that the latter are
 circumscribed within very moderate bounds in pursuing this
 inquiry we must bear in mind that we are not to confine our view to
 the present period but to look forward to remote futurity
 constitutions of civil government are not to be framed upon a
 calculation of existing exigencies but upon a combination of these
 with the probable exigencies of ages according to the natural and
 tried course of human affairs nothing therefore can be more
 fallacious than to infer the extent of any power proper to be
 lodged in the national government from an estimate of its immediate
 necessities there ought to be a capacity to provide for future
 contingencies as they may happen and as these are illimitable in
 their nature it is impossible safely to limit that capacity it is
 true perhaps that a computation might be made with sufficient
 accuracy to answer the purpose of the quantity of revenue requisite
 to discharge the subsisting engagements of the union and to
 maintain those establishments which for some time to come would
 suffice in time of peace but would it be wise or would it not
 rather be the extreme of folly to stop at this point and to leave
 the government intrusted with the care of the national defense in a
 state of absolute incapacity to provide for the protection of the
 community against future invasions of the public peace by foreign
 war or domestic convulsions if on the contrary we ought to
 exceed this point where can we stop short of an indefinite power
 of providing for emergencies as they may arise though it is easy
 to assert in general terms the possibility of forming a rational
 judgment of a due provision against probable dangers yet we may
 safely challenge those who make the assertion to bring forward their
 data and may affirm that they would be found as vague and uncertain
 as any that could be produced to establish the probable duration of
 the world observations confined to the mere prospects of internal
 attacks can deserve no weight though even these will admit of no
 satisfactory calculation but if we mean to be a commercial people
 it must form a part of our policy to be able one day to defend that
 commerce the support of a navy and of naval wars would involve
 contingencies that must baffle all the efforts of political
 arithmetic
admitting that we ought to try the novel and absurd experiment
 in politics of tying up the hands of government from offensive war
 founded upon reasons of state yet certainly we ought not to disable
 it from guarding the community against the ambition or enmity of
 other nations a cloud has been for some time hanging over the
 european world if it should break forth into a storm who can
 insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent
 upon us no reasonable man would hastily pronounce that we are
 entirely out of its reach or if the combustible materials that now
 seem to be collecting should be dissipated without coming to
 maturity or if a flame should be kindled without extending to us
 what security can we have that our tranquillity will long remain
 undisturbed from some other cause or from some other quarter let
 us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to our
 option that however moderate or unambitious we may be we cannot
 count upon the moderation or hope to extinguish the ambition of
 others who could have imagined at the conclusion of the last war
 that france and britain wearied and exhausted as they both were
 would so soon have looked with so hostile an aspect upon each other
 to judge from the history of mankind we shall be compelled to
 conclude that the fiery and destructive passions of war reign in the
 human breast with much more powerful sway than the mild and
 beneficent sentiments of peace and that to model our political
 systems upon speculations of lasting tranquillity is to calculate
 on the weaker springs of the human character
what are the chief sources of expense in every government what
 has occasioned that enormous accumulation of debts with which
 several of the european nations are oppressed the answers plainly
 is wars and rebellions the support of those institutions which
 are necessary to guard the body politic against these two most
 mortal diseases of society the expenses arising from those
 institutions which are relative to the mere domestic police of a
 state to the support of its legislative executive and judicial
 departments with their different appendages and to the
 encouragement of agriculture and manufactures which will comprehend
 almost all the objects of state expenditure are insignificant in
 comparison with those which relate to the national defense
in the kingdom of great britain where all the ostentatious
 apparatus of monarchy is to be provided for not above a fifteenth
 part of the annual income of the nation is appropriated to the class
 of expenses last mentioned the other fourteen fifteenths are
 absorbed in the payment of the interest of debts contracted for
 carrying on the wars in which that country has been engaged and in
 the maintenance of fleets and armies if on the one hand it
 should be observed that the expenses incurred in the prosecution of
 the ambitious enterprises and vainglorious pursuits of a monarchy
 are not a proper standard by which to judge of those which might be
 necessary in a republic it ought on the other hand to be remarked
 that there should be as great a disproportion between the profusion
 and extravagance of a wealthy kingdom in its domestic
 administration and the frugality and economy which in that
 particular become the modest simplicity of republican government
 if we balance a proper deduction from one side against that which
 it is supposed ought to be made from the other the proportion may
 still be considered as holding good
but let us advert to the large debt which we have ourselves
 contracted in a single war and let us only calculate on a common
 share of the events which disturb the peace of nations and we shall
 instantly perceive without the aid of any elaborate illustration
 that there must always be an immense disproportion between the
 objects of federal and state expenditures it is true that several
 of the states separately are encumbered with considerable debts
 which are an excrescence of the late war but this cannot happen
 again if the proposed system be adopted and when these debts are
 discharged the only call for revenue of any consequence which the
 state governments will continue to experience will be for the mere
 support of their respective civil list to which if we add all
 contingencies the total amount in every state ought to fall
 considerably short of two hundred thousand pounds
in framing a government for posterity as well as ourselves we
 ought in those provisions which are designed to be permanent to
 calculate not on temporary but on permanent causes of expense if
 this principle be a just one our attention would be directed to a
 provision in favor of the state governments for an annual sum of
 about two hundred thousand pounds while the exigencies of the
 union could be susceptible of no limits even in imagination in
 this view of the subject by what logic can it be maintained that
 the local governments ought to command in perpetuity an exclusive
 source of revenue for any sum beyond the extent of two hundred
 thousand pounds to extend its power further in exclusion of the
 authority of the union would be to take the resources of the
 community out of those hands which stood in need of them for the
 public welfare in order to put them into other hands which could
 have no just or proper occasion for them
suppose then the convention had been inclined to proceed upon
 the principle of a repartition of the objects of revenue between
 the union and its members in proportion to their comparative
 necessities what particular fund could have been selected for the
 use of the states that would not either have been too much or too
 little too little for their present too much for their future
 wants as to the line of separation between external and internal
 taxes this would leave to the states at a rough computation the
 command of two thirds of the resources of the community to defray
 from a tenth to a twentieth part of its expenses and to the union
 one third of the resources of the community to defray from nine
 tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expenses if we desert this
 boundary and content ourselves with leaving to the states an
 exclusive power of taxing houses and lands there would still be a
 great disproportion between the means and the end the possession
 of one third of the resources of the community to supply at most
 one tenth of its wants if any fund could have been selected and
 appropriated equal to and not greater than the object it would
 have been inadequate to the discharge of the existing debts of the
 particular states and would have left them dependent on the union
 for a provision for this purpose
the preceding train of observation will justify the position
 which has been elsewhere laid down that a concurrent jurisdiction
 in the article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an
 entire subordination in respect to this branch of power of state
 authority to that of the union any separation of the objects of
 revenue that could have been fallen upon would have amounted to a
 sacrifice of the great interests of the union to the power of the
 individual states the convention thought the concurrent
 jurisdiction preferable to that subordination and it is evident
 that it has at least the merit of reconciling an indefinite
 constitutional power of taxation in the federal government with an
 adequate and independent power in the states to provide for their
 own necessities there remain a few other lights in which this
 important subject of taxation will claim a further consideration
publius
federalist no 
the same subject continued
concerning the general power of taxation
for the independent journal
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
before we proceed to examine any other objections to an
 indefinite power of taxation in the union i shall make one general
 remark which is that if the jurisdiction of the national
 government in the article of revenue should be restricted to
 particular objects it would naturally occasion an undue proportion
 of the public burdens to fall upon those objects two evils would
 spring from this source the oppression of particular branches of
 industry and an unequal distribution of the taxes as well among
 the several states as among the citizens of the same state
suppose as has been contended for the federal power of
 taxation were to be confined to duties on imports it is evident
 that the government for want of being able to command other
 resources would frequently be tempted to extend these duties to an
 injurious excess there are persons who imagine that they can never
 be carried to too great a length since the higher they are the
 more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an extravagant
 consumption to produce a favorable balance of trade and to promote
 domestic manufactures but all extremes are pernicious in various
 ways exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a general
 spirit of smuggling which is always prejudicial to the fair
 trader and eventually to the revenue itself they tend to render
 other classes of the community tributary in an improper degree to
 the manufacturing classes to whom they give a premature monopoly of
 the markets they sometimes force industry out of its more natural
 channels into others in which it flows with less advantage and in
 the last place they oppress the merchant who is often obliged to
 pay them himself without any retribution from the consumer when
 the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market the consumer
 generally pays the duty but when the markets happen to be
 overstocked a great proportion falls upon the merchant and
 sometimes not only exhausts his profits but breaks in upon his
 capital i am apt to think that a division of the duty between the
 seller and the buyer more often happens than is commonly imagined
 it is not always possible to raise the price of a commodity in
 exact proportion to every additional imposition laid upon it the
 merchant especially in a country of small commercial capital is
 often under a necessity of keeping prices down in order to a more
 expeditious sale
the maxim that the consumer is the payer is so much oftener
 true than the reverse of the proposition that it is far more
 equitable that the duties on imports should go into a common stock
 than that they should redound to the exclusive benefit of the
 importing states but it is not so generally true as to render it
 equitable that those duties should form the only national fund
 when they are paid by the merchant they operate as an additional
 tax upon the importing state whose citizens pay their proportion of
 them in the character of consumers in this view they are
 productive of inequality among the states which inequality would
 be increased with the increased extent of the duties the
 confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts
 would be attended with inequality from a different cause between
 the manufacturing and the nonmanufacturing states the states
 which can go farthest towards the supply of their own wants by
 their own manufactures will not according to their numbers or
 wealth consume so great a proportion of imported articles as those
 states which are not in the same favorable situation they would
 not therefore in this mode alone contribute to the public treasury
 in a ratio to their abilities to make them do this it is necessary
 that recourse be had to excises the proper objects of which are
 particular kinds of manufactures new york is more deeply
 interested in these considerations than such of her citizens as
 contend for limiting the power of the union to external taxation may
 be aware of new york is an importing state and is not likely
 speedily to be to any great extent a manufacturing state she
 would of course suffer in a double light from restraining the
 jurisdiction of the union to commercial imposts
so far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the
 import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be
 observed conformably to a remark made in another part of these
 papers that the interest of the revenue itself would be a
 sufficient guard against such an extreme i readily admit that this
 would be the case as long as other resources were open but if the
 avenues to them were closed hope stimulated by necessity would
 beget experiments fortified by rigorous precautions and additional
 penalties which for a time would have the intended effect till
 there had been leisure to contrive expedients to elude these new
 precautions the first success would be apt to inspire false
 opinions which it might require a long course of subsequent
 experience to correct necessity especially in politics often
 occasions false hopes false reasonings and a system of measures
 correspondingly erroneous but even if this supposed excess should
 not be a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of
 taxation the inequalities spoken of would still ensue though not
 in the same degree from the other causes that have been noticed
 let us now return to the examination of objections
one which if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition
 seems most to be relied on is that the house of representatives is
 not sufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different
 classes of citizens in order to combine the interests and feelings
 of every part of the community and to produce a due sympathy
 between the representative body and its constituents this argument
 presents itself under a very specious and seducing form and is
 well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of those to whom it is
 addressed but when we come to dissect it with attention it will
 appear to be made up of nothing but fairsounding words the object
 it seems to aim at is in the first place impracticable and in the
 sense in which it is contended for is unnecessary i reserve for
 another place the discussion of the question which relates to the
 sufficiency of the representative body in respect to numbers and
 shall content myself with examining here the particular use which
 has been made of a contrary supposition in reference to the
 immediate subject of our inquiries
the idea of an actual representation of all classes of the
 people by persons of each class is altogether visionary unless
 it were expressly provided in the constitution that each different
 occupation should send one or more members the thing would never
 take place in practice mechanics and manufacturers will always be
 inclined with few exceptions to give their votes to merchants in
 preference to persons of their own professions or trades those
 discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and
 manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise
 and industry many of them indeed are immediately connected with
 the operations of commerce they know that the merchant is their
 natural patron and friend and they are aware that however great
 the confidence they may justly feel in their own good sense their
 interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by
 themselves they are sensible that their habits in life have not
 been such as to give them those acquired endowments without which
 in a deliberative assembly the greatest natural abilities are for
 the most part useless and that the influence and weight and
 superior acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a
 contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the
 public councils unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading
 interests these considerations and many others that might be
 mentioned prove and experience confirms it that artisans and
 manufacturers will commonly be disposed to bestow their votes upon
 merchants and those whom they recommend we must therefore consider
 merchants as the natural representatives of all these classes of the
 community
with regard to the learned professions little need be observed
 they truly form no distinct interest in society and according to
 their situation and talents will be indiscriminately the objects of
 the confidence and choice of each other and of other parts of the
 community
nothing remains but the landed interest and this in a
 political view and particularly in relation to taxes i take to be
 perfectly united from the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest
 tenant no tax can be laid on land which will not affect the
 proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a
 single acre every landholder will therefore have a common interest
 to keep the taxes on land as low as possible and common interest
 may always be reckoned upon as the surest bond of sympathy but if
 we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent
 landholder and the middling farmer what reason is there to
 conclude that the first would stand a better chance of being
 deputed to the national legislature than the last if we take fact
 as our guide and look into our own senate and assembly we shall
 find that moderate proprietors of land prevail in both nor is this
 less the case in the senate which consists of a smaller number
 than in the assembly which is composed of a greater number where
 the qualifications of the electors are the same whether they have
 to choose a small or a large number their votes will fall upon
 those in whom they have most confidence whether these happen to be
 men of large fortunes or of moderate property or of no property at
 all
it is said to be necessary that all classes of citizens should
 have some of their own number in the representative body in order
 that their feelings and interests may be the better understood and
 attended to but we have seen that this will never happen under any
 arrangement that leaves the votes of the people free where this is
 the case the representative body with too few exceptions to have
 any influence on the spirit of the government will be composed of
 landholders merchants and men of the learned professions but
 where is the danger that the interests and feelings of the different
 classes of citizens will not be understood or attended to by these
 three descriptions of men will not the landholder know and feel
 whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property
 and will he not from his own interest in that species of property
 be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or
 encumber it will not the merchant understand and be disposed to
 cultivate as far as may be proper the interests of the mechanic
 and manufacturing arts to which his commerce is so nearly allied
 will not the man of the learned profession who will feel a
 neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of
 industry be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them
 ready to promote either so far as it shall appear to him conducive
 to the general interests of the society
if we take into the account the momentary humors or dispositions
 which may happen to prevail in particular parts of the society and
 to which a wise administration will never be inattentive is the man
 whose situation leads to extensive inquiry and information less
 likely to be a competent judge of their nature extent and
 foundation than one whose observation does not travel beyond the
 circle of his neighbors and acquaintances is it not natural that a
 man who is a candidate for the favor of the people and who is
 dependent on the suffrages of his fellowcitizens for the
 continuance of his public honors should take care to inform himself
 of their dispositions and inclinations and should be willing to
 allow them their proper degree of influence upon his conduct this
 dependence and the necessity of being bound himself and his
 posterity by the laws to which he gives his assent are the true
 and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the
 representative and the constituent
there is no part of the administration of government that
 requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of the
 principles of political economy so much as the business of taxation
 the man who understands those principles best will be least likely
 to resort to oppressive expedients or sacrifice any particular
 class of citizens to the procurement of revenue it might be
 demonstrated that the most productive system of finance will always
 be the least burdensome there can be no doubt that in order to a
 judicious exercise of the power of taxation it is necessary that
 the person in whose hands it should be acquainted with the general
 genius habits and modes of thinking of the people at large and
 with the resources of the country and this is all that can be
 reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and feelings of the
 people in any other sense the proposition has either no meaning
 or an absurd one and in that sense let every considerate citizen
 judge for himself where the requisite qualification is most likely
 to be found

the same subject continued
concerning the general power of taxation
from the new york packet
tuesday january  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
we have seen that the result of the observations to which the
 foregoing number has been principally devoted is that from the
 natural operation of the different interests and views of the
 various classes of the community whether the representation of the
 people be more or less numerous it will consist almost entirely of
 proprietors of land of merchants and of members of the learned
 professions who will truly represent all those different interests
 and views if it should be objected that we have seen other
 descriptions of men in the local legislatures i answer that it is
 admitted there are exceptions to the rule but not in sufficient
 number to influence the general complexion or character of the
 government there are strong minds in every walk of life that will
 rise superior to the disadvantages of situation and will command
 the tribute due to their merit not only from the classes to which
 they particularly belong but from the society in general the door
 ought to be equally open to all and i trust for the credit of
 human nature that we shall see examples of such vigorous plants
 flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of state legislation
 but occasional instances of this sort will not render the reasoning
 founded upon the general course of things less conclusive
the subject might be placed in several other lights that would
 all lead to the same result and in particular it might be asked
 what greater affinity or relation of interest can be conceived
 between the carpenter and blacksmith and the linen manufacturer or
 stocking weaver than between the merchant and either of them it
 is notorious that there are often as great rivalships between
 different branches of the mechanic or manufacturing arts as there
 are between any of the departments of labor and industry so that
 unless the representative body were to be far more numerous than
 would be consistent with any idea of regularity or wisdom in its
 deliberations it is impossible that what seems to be the spirit of
 the objection we have been considering should ever be realized in
 practice but i forbear to dwell any longer on a matter which has
 hitherto worn too loose a garb to admit even of an accurate
 inspection of its real shape or tendency
there is another objection of a somewhat more precise nature
 that claims our attention it has been asserted that a power of
 internal taxation in the national legislature could never be
 exercised with advantage as well from the want of a sufficient
 knowledge of local circumstances as from an interference between
 the revenue laws of the union and of the particular states the
 supposition of a want of proper knowledge seems to be entirely
 destitute of foundation if any question is depending in a state
 legislature respecting one of the counties which demands a
 knowledge of local details how is it acquired no doubt from the
 information of the members of the county cannot the like knowledge
 be obtained in the national legislature from the representatives of
 each state and is it not to be presumed that the men who will
 generally be sent there will be possessed of the necessary degree of
 intelligence to be able to communicate that information is the
 knowledge of local circumstances as applied to taxation a minute
 topographical acquaintance with all the mountains rivers streams
 highways and bypaths in each state or is it a general
 acquaintance with its situation and resources with the state of its
 agriculture commerce manufactures with the nature of its products
 and consumptions with the different degrees and kinds of its
 wealth property and industry
nations in general even under governments of the more popular
 kind usually commit the administration of their finances to single
 men or to boards composed of a few individuals who digest and
 prepare in the first instance the plans of taxation which are
 afterwards passed into laws by the authority of the sovereign or
 legislature
inquisitive and enlightened statesmen are deemed everywhere best
 qualified to make a judicious selection of the objects proper for
 revenue which is a clear indication as far as the sense of
 mankind can have weight in the question of the species of knowledge
 of local circumstances requisite to the purposes of taxation
the taxes intended to be comprised under the general
 denomination of internal taxes may be subdivided into those of the
 direct and those of the indirect kind though the objection be made
 to both yet the reasoning upon it seems to be confined to the
 former branch and indeed as to the latter by which must be
 understood duties and excises on articles of consumption one is at
 a loss to conceive what can be the nature of the difficulties
 apprehended the knowledge relating to them must evidently be of a
 kind that will either be suggested by the nature of the article
 itself or can easily be procured from any wellinformed man
 especially of the mercantile class the circumstances that may
 distinguish its situation in one state from its situation in another
 must be few simple and easy to be comprehended the principal
 thing to be attended to would be to avoid those articles which had
 been previously appropriated to the use of a particular state and
 there could be no difficulty in ascertaining the revenue system of
 each this could always be known from the respective codes of laws
 as well as from the information of the members from the several
 states
the objection when applied to real property or to houses and
 lands appears to have at first sight more foundation but even in
 this view it will not bear a close examination land taxes are co
 monly laid in one of two modes either by actual valuations
 permanent or periodical or by occasional assessments at the
 discretion or according to the best judgment of certain officers
 whose duty it is to make them in either case the execution of the
 business which alone requires the knowledge of local details must
 be devolved upon discreet persons in the character of commissioners
 or assessors elected by the people or appointed by the government
 for the purpose all that the law can do must be to name the
 persons or to prescribe the manner of their election or appointment
 to fix their numbers and qualifications and to draw the general
 outlines of their powers and duties and what is there in all this
 that cannot as well be performed by the national legislature as by a
 state legislature the attention of either can only reach to
 general principles local details as already observed must be
 referred to those who are to execute the plan
but there is a simple point of view in which this matter may be
 placed that must be altogether satisfactory the national
 legislature can make use of the system of each state within that
 state the method of laying and collecting this species of taxes in
 each state can in all its parts be adopted and employed by the
 federal government
let it be recollected that the proportion of these taxes is not
 to be left to the discretion of the national legislature but is to
 be determined by the numbers of each state as described in the
 second section of the first article an actual census or
 enumeration of the people must furnish the rule a circumstance
 which effectually shuts the door to partiality or oppression the
 abuse of this power of taxation seems to have been provided against
 with guarded circumspection in addition to the precaution just
 mentioned there is a provision that all duties imposts and
 excises shall be uniform throughout the united states
it has been very properly observed by different speakers and
 writers on the side of the constitution that if the exercise of the
 power of internal taxation by the union should be discovered on
 experiment to be really inconvenient the federal government may
 then forbear the use of it and have recourse to requisitions in its
 stead by way of answer to this it has been triumphantly asked
 why not in the first instance omit that ambiguous power and rely
 upon the latter resource two solid answers may be given the
 first is that the exercise of that power if convenient will be
 preferable because it will be more effectual and it is impossible
 to prove in theory or otherwise than by the experiment that it
 cannot be advantageously exercised the contrary indeed appears
 most probable the second answer is that the existence of such a
 power in the constitution will have a strong influence in giving
 efficacy to requisitions when the states know that the union can
 apply itself without their agency it will be a powerful motive for
 exertion on their part
as to the interference of the revenue laws of the union and of
 its members we have already seen that there can be no clashing or
 repugnancy of authority the laws cannot therefore in a legal
 sense interfere with each other and it is far from impossible to
 avoid an interference even in the policy of their different systems
 an effectual expedient for this purpose will be mutually to
 abstain from those objects which either side may have first had
 recourse to as neither can control the other each will have an
 obvious and sensible interest in this reciprocal forbearance and
 where there is an immediate common interest we may safely count
 upon its operation when the particular debts of the states are
 done away and their expenses come to be limited within their
 natural compass the possibility almost of interference will vanish
 a small land tax will answer the purpose of the states and will be
 their most simple and most fit resource
many spectres have been raised out of this power of internal
 taxation to excite the apprehensions of the people double sets of
 revenue officers a duplication of their burdens by double
 taxations and the frightful forms of odious and oppressive
 polltaxes have been played off with all the ingenious dexterity of
 political legerdemain
as to the first point there are two cases in which there can be
 no room for double sets of officers one where the right of
 imposing the tax is exclusively vested in the union which applies
 to the duties on imports the other where the object has not
 fallen under any state regulation or provision which may be
 applicable to a variety of objects in other cases the probability
 is that the united states will either wholly abstain from the
 objects preoccupied for local purposes or will make use of the
 state officers and state regulations for collecting the additional
 imposition this will best answer the views of revenue because it
 will save expense in the collection and will best avoid any
 occasion of disgust to the state governments and to the people at
 all events here is a practicable expedient for avoiding such an
 inconvenience and nothing more can be required than to show that
 evils predicted to not necessarily result from the plan
as to any argument derived from a supposed system of influence
 it is a sufficient answer to say that it ought not to be presumed
 but the supposition is susceptible of a more precise answer if
 such a spirit should infest the councils of the union the most
 certain road to the accomplishment of its aim would be to employ the
 state officers as much as possible and to attach them to the union
 by an accumulation of their emoluments this would serve to turn
 the tide of state influence into the channels of the national
 government instead of making federal influence flow in an opposite
 and adverse current but all suppositions of this kind are
 invidious and ought to be banished from the consideration of the
 great question before the people they can answer no other end than
 to cast a mist over the truth
as to the suggestion of double taxation the answer is plain
 the wants of the union are to be supplied in one way or another
 if to be done by the authority of the federal government it will
 not be to be done by that of the state government the quantity of
 taxes to be paid by the community must be the same in either case
 with this advantage if the provision is to be made by the
 union that the capital resource of commercial imposts which is the
 most convenient branch of revenue can be prudently improved to a
 much greater extent under federal than under state regulation and
 of course will render it less necessary to recur to more
 inconvenient methods and with this further advantage that as far
 as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of
 internal taxation it will impose a disposition to greater care in
 the choice and arrangement of the means and must naturally tend to
 make it a fixed point of policy in the national administration to go
 as far as may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich
 tributary to the public treasury in order to diminish the necessity
 of those impositions which might create dissatisfaction in the
 poorer and most numerous classes of the society happy it is when
 the interest which the government has in the preservation of its own
 power coincides with a proper distribution of the public burdens
 and tends to guard the least wealthy part of the community from
 oppression
as to poll taxes i without scruple confess my disapprobation
 of them and though they have prevailed from an early period in
 those states  which have uniformly been the most tenacious of
 their rights i should lament to see them introduced into practice
 under the national government but does it follow because there is
 a power to lay them that they will actually be laid every state in
 the union has power to impose taxes of this kind and yet in
 several of them they are unknown in practice are the state
 governments to be stigmatized as tyrannies because they possess
 this power if they are not with what propriety can the like power
 justify such a charge against the national government or even be
 urged as an obstacle to its adoption as little friendly as i am to
 the species of imposition i still feel a thorough conviction that
 the power of having recourse to it ought to exist in the federal
 government there are certain emergencies of nations in which
 expedients that in the ordinary state of things ought to be
 forborne become essential to the public weal and the government
 from the possibility of such emergencies ought ever to have the
 option of making use of them the real scarcity of objects in this
 country which may be considered as productive sources of revenue
 is a reason peculiar to itself for not abridging the discretion of
 the national councils in this respect there may exist certain
 critical and tempestuous conjunctures of the state in which a poll
 tax may become an inestimable resource and as i know nothing to
 exempt this portion of the globe from the common calamities that
 have befallen other parts of it i acknowledge my aversion to every
 project that is calculated to disarm the government of a single
 weapon which in any possible contingency might be usefully employed
 for the general defense and security
i have now gone through the examination of such of the powers
 proposed to be vested in the united states which may be considered
 as having an immediate relation to the energy of the government
 and have endeavored to answer the principal objections which have
 been made to them i have passed over in silence those minor
 authorities which are either too inconsiderable to have been
 thought worthy of the hostilities of the opponents of the
 constitution or of too manifest propriety to admit of controversy
 the mass of judiciary power however might have claimed an
 investigation under this head had it not been for the consideration
 that its organization and its extent may be more advantageously
 considered in connection this has determined me to refer it to the
 branch of our inquiries upon which we shall next enter
publius
fna the new england states
federalist no 
concerning the difficulties of the convention in devising a proper
 form of government
from the daily advertiser
friday january  
madison
to the people of the state of new york
in reviewing the defects of the existing confederation and
 showing that they cannot be supplied by a government of less energy
 than that before the public several of the most important
 principles of the latter fell of course under consideration but as
 the ultimate object of these papers is to determine clearly and
 fully the merits of this constitution and the expediency of
 adopting it our plan cannot be complete without taking a more
 critical and thorough survey of the work of the convention without
 examining it on all its sides comparing it in all its parts and
 calculating its probable effects
that this remaining task may be executed under impressions
 conducive to a just and fair result some reflections must in this
 place be indulged which candor previously suggests
it is a misfortune inseparable from human affairs that public
 measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation
 which is essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to
 advance or obstruct the public good and that this spirit is more
 apt to be diminished than promoted by those occasions which require
 an unusual exercise of it to those who have been led by experience
 to attend to this consideration it could not appear surprising
 that the act of the convention which recommends so many important
 changes and innovations which may be viewed in so many lights and
 relations and which touches the springs of so many passions and
 interests should find or excite dispositions unfriendly both on
 one side and on the other to a fair discussion and accurate
 judgment of its merits in some it has been too evident from their
 own publications that they have scanned the proposed constitution
 not only with a predisposition to censure but with a
 predetermination to condemn as the language held by others betrays
 an opposite predetermination or bias which must render their
 opinions also of little moment in the question in placing
 however these different characters on a level with respect to the
 weight of their opinions i wish not to insinuate that there may not
 be a material difference in the purity of their intentions it is
 but just to remark in favor of the latter description that as our
 situation is universally admitted to be peculiarly critical and to
 require indispensably that something should be done for our relief
 the predetermined patron of what has been actually done may have
 taken his bias from the weight of these considerations as well as
 from considerations of a sinister nature the predetermined
 adversary on the other hand can have been governed by no venial
 motive whatever the intentions of the first may be upright as
 they may on the contrary be culpable the views of the last cannot
 be upright and must be culpable but the truth is that these
 papers are not addressed to persons falling under either of these
 characters they solicit the attention of those only who add to a
 sincere zeal for the happiness of their country a temper favorable
 to a just estimate of the means of promoting it
persons of this character will proceed to an examination of the
 plan submitted by the convention not only without a disposition to
 find or to magnify faults but will see the propriety of
 reflecting that a faultless plan was not to be expected nor will
 they barely make allowances for the errors which may be chargeable
 on the fallibility to which the convention as a body of men were
 liable but will keep in mind that they themselves also are but
 men and ought not to assume an infallibility in rejudging the
 fallible opinions of others
with equal readiness will it be perceived that besides these
 inducements to candor many allowances ought to be made for the
 difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred
 to the convention
the novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us it has
 been shown in the course of these papers that the existing
 confederation is founded on principles which are fallacious that
 we must consequently change this first foundation and with it the
 superstructure resting upon it it has been shown that the other
 confederacies which could be consulted as precedents have been
 vitiated by the same erroneous principles and can therefore furnish
 no other light than that of beacons which give warning of the
 course to be shunned without pointing out that which ought to be
 pursued the most that the convention could do in such a situation
 was to avoid the errors suggested by the past experience of other
 countries as well as of our own and to provide a convenient mode
 of rectifying their own errors as future experiences may unfold
 them
among the difficulties encountered by the convention a very
 important one must have lain in combining the requisite stability
 and energy in government with the inviolable attention due to
 liberty and to the republican form without substantially
 accomplishing this part of their undertaking they would have very
 imperfectly fulfilled the object of their appointment or the
 expectation of the public yet that it could not be easily
 accomplished will be denied by no one who is unwilling to betray
 his ignorance of the subject energy in government is essential to
 that security against external and internal danger and to that
 prompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the very
 definition of good government stability in government is essential
 to national character and to the advantages annexed to it as well
 as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people which
 are among the chief blessings of civil society an irregular and
 mutable legislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious
 to the people and it may be pronounced with assurance that the
 people of this country enlightened as they are with regard to the
 nature and interested as the great body of them are in the
 effects of good government will never be satisfied till some remedy
 be applied to the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize
 the state administrations on comparing however these valuable
 ingredients with the vital principles of liberty we must perceive
 at once the difficulty of mingling them together in their due
 proportions the genius of republican liberty seems to demand on
 one side not only that all power should be derived from the people
 but that those intrusted with it should be kept in independence on
 the people by a short duration of their appointments and that
 even during this short period the trust should be placed not in a
 few but a number of hands stability on the contrary requires
 that the hands in which power is lodged should continue for a length
 of time the same a frequent change of men will result from a
 frequent return of elections and a frequent change of measures
 from a frequent change of men whilst energy in government requires
 not only a certain duration of power but the execution of it by a
 single hand
how far the convention may have succeeded in this part of their
 work will better appear on a more accurate view of it from the
 cursory view here taken it must clearly appear to have been an
 arduous part
not less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper
 line of partition between the authority of the general and that of
 the state governments every man will be sensible of this
 difficulty in proportion as he has been accustomed to contemplate
 and discriminate objects extensive and complicated in their nature
 the faculties of the mind itself have never yet been distinguished
 and defined with satisfactory precision by all the efforts of the
 most acute and metaphysical philosophers sense perception
 judgment desire volition memory imagination are found to be
 separated by such delicate shades and minute gradations that their
 boundaries have eluded the most subtle investigations and remain a
 pregnant source of ingenious disquisition and controversy the
 boundaries between the great kingdom of nature and still more
 between the various provinces and lesser portions into which they
 are subdivided afford another illustration of the same important
 truth the most sagacious and laborious naturalists have never yet
 succeeded in tracing with certainty the line which separates the
 district of vegetable life from the neighboring region of
 unorganized matter or which marks the ermination of the former and
 the commencement of the animal empire a still greater obscurity
 lies in the distinctive characters by which the objects in each of
 these great departments of nature have been arranged and assorted
when we pass from the works of nature in which all the
 delineations are perfectly accurate and appear to be otherwise only
 from the imperfection of the eye which surveys them to the
 institutions of man in which the obscurity arises as well from the
 object itself as from the organ by which it is contemplated we must
 perceive the necessity of moderating still further our expectations
 and hopes from the efforts of human sagacity experience has
 instructed us that no skill in the science of government has yet
 been able to discriminate and define with sufficient certainty its
 three great provinces the legislative executive and judiciary or
 even the privileges and powers of the different legislative branches
 questions daily occur in the course of practice which prove the
 obscurity which reins in these subjects and which puzzle the
 greatest adepts in political science
the experience of ages with the continued and combined labors
 of the most enlightened legislatures and jurists has been equally
 unsuccessful in delineating the several objects and limits of
 different codes of laws and different tribunals of justice the
 precise extent of the common law and the statute law the maritime
 law the ecclesiastical law the law of corporations and other
 local laws and customs remains still to be clearly and finally
 established in great britain where accuracy in such subjects has
 been more industriously pursued than in any other part of the world
 the jurisdiction of her several courts general and local of law
 of equity of admiralty etc is not less a source of frequent and
 intricate discussions sufficiently denoting the indeterminate
 limits by which they are respectively circumscribed all new laws
 though penned with the greatest technical skill and passed on the
 fullest and most mature deliberation are considered as more or less
 obscure and equivocal until their meaning be liquidated and
 ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications
 besides the obscurity arising from the complexity of objects and
 the imperfection of the human faculties the medium through which
 the conceptions of men are conveyed to each other adds a fresh
 embarrassment the use of words is to express ideas perspicuity
 therefore requires not only that the ideas should be distinctly
 formed but that they should be expressed by words distinctly and
 exclusively appropriate to them but no language is so copious as
 to supply words and phrases for every complex idea or so correct as
 not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas hence it
 must happen that however accurately objects may be discriminated in
 themselves and however accurately the discrimination may be
 considered the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the
 inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered and this
 unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less according to the
 complexity and novelty of the objects defined when the almighty
 himself condescends to address mankind in their own language his
 meaning luminous as it must be is rendered dim and doubtful by the
 cloudy medium through which it is communicated
here then are three sources of vague and incorrect
 definitions indistinctness of the object imperfection of the
 organ of conception inadequateness of the vehicle of ideas any
 one of these must produce a certain degree of obscurity the
 convention in delineating the boundary between the federal and
 state jurisdictions must have experienced the full effect of them
 all
to the difficulties already mentioned may be added the
 interfering pretensions of the larger and smaller states we cannot
 err in supposing that the former would contend for a participation
 in the government fully proportioned to their superior wealth and
 importance and that the latter would not be less tenacious of the
 equality at present enjoyed by them we may well suppose that
 neither side would entirely yield to the other and consequently
 that the struggle could be terminated only by compromise it is
 extremely probable also that after the ratio of representation had
 been adjusted this very compromise must have produced a fresh
 struggle between the same parties to give such a turn to the
 organization of the government and to the distribution of its
 powers as would increase the importance of the branches in forming
 which they had respectively obtained the greatest share of influence
 there are features in the constitution which warrant each of these
 suppositions and as far as either of them is well founded it
 shows that the convention must have been compelled to sacrifice
 theoretical propriety to the force of extraneous considerations
nor could it have been the large and small states only which
 would marshal themselves in opposition to each other on various
 points other combinations resulting from a difference of local
 position and policy must have created additional difficulties as
 every state may be divided into different districts and its
 citizens into different classes which give birth to contending
 interests and local jealousies so the different parts of the united
 states are distinguished from each other by a variety of
 circumstances which produce a like effect on a larger scale and
 although this variety of interests for reasons sufficiently
 explained in a former paper may have a salutary influence on the
 administration of the government when formed yet every one must be
 sensible of the contrary influence which must have been experienced
 in the task of forming it
would it be wonderful if under the pressure of all these
 difficulties the convention should have been forced into some
 deviations from that artificial structure and regular symmetry which
 an abstract view of the subject might lead an ingenious theorist to
 bestow on a constitution planned in his closet or in his
 imagination the real wonder is that so many difficulties should
 have been surmounted and surmounted with a unanimity almost as
 unprecedented as it must have been unexpected it is impossible for
 any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance without partaking
 of the astonishment it is impossible for the man of pious
 reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that almighty hand
 which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in
 the critical stages of the revolution
we had occasion in a former paper to take notice of the
 repeated trials which have been unsuccessfully made in the united
 netherlands for reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their
 constitution the history of almost all the great councils and
 consultations held among mankind for reconciling their discordant
 opinions assuaging their mutual jealousies and adjusting their
 respective interests is a history of factions contentions and
 disappointments and may be classed among the most dark and degraded
 pictures which display the infirmities and depravities of the human
 character if in a few scattered instances a brighter aspect is
 presented they serve only as exceptions to admonish us of the
 general truth and by their lustre to darken the gloom of the
 adverse prospect to which they are contrasted in revolving the
 causes from which these exceptions result and applying them to the
 particular instances before us we are necessarily led to two
 important conclusions the first is that the convention must have
 enjoyed in a very singular degree an exemption from the
 pestilential influence of party animosities the disease most
 incident to deliberative bodies and most apt to contaminate their
 proceedings the second conclusion is that all the deputations
 composing the convention were satisfactorily accommodated by the
 final act or were induced to accede to it by a deep conviction of
 the necessity of sacrificing private opinions and partial interests
 to the public good and by a despair of seeing this necessity
 diminished by delays or by new experiments

the same subject continued and the incoherence of the objections
 to the new plan exposed
from the new york packet
tuesday january  
madison
to the people of the state of new york
it is not a little remarkable that in every case reported by
 ancient history in which government has been established with
 deliberation and consent the task of framing it has not been
 committed to an assembly of men but has been performed by some
 individual citizen of preeminent wisdom and approved integrity
minos we learn was the primitive founder of the government of
 crete as zaleucus was of that of the locrians theseus first and
 after him draco and solon instituted the government of athens
 lycurgus was the lawgiver of sparta the foundation of the
 original government of rome was laid by romulus and the work
 completed by two of his elective successors numa and tullius
 hostilius on the abolition of royalty the consular administration
 was substituted by brutus who stepped forward with a project for
 such a reform which he alleged had been prepared by tullius
 hostilius and to which his address obtained the assent and
 ratification of the senate and people this remark is applicable to
 confederate governments also amphictyon we are told was the
 author of that which bore his name the achaean league received its
 first birth from achaeus and its second from aratus
what degree of agency these reputed lawgivers might have in
 their respective establishments or how far they might be clothed
 with the legitimate authority of the people cannot in every
 instance be ascertained in some however the proceeding was
 strictly regular draco appears to have been intrusted by the
 people of athens with indefinite powers to reform its government and
 laws and solon according to plutarch was in a manner compelled
 by the universal suffrage of his fellowcitizens to take upon him
 the sole and absolute power of newmodeling the constitution the
 proceedings under lycurgus were less regular but as far as the
 advocates for a regular reform could prevail they all turned their
 eyes towards the single efforts of that celebrated patriot and sage
 instead of seeking to bring about a revolution by the intervention
 of a deliberative body of citizens
whence could it have proceeded that a people jealous as the
 greeks were of their liberty should so far abandon the rules of
 caution as to place their destiny in the hands of a single citizen
 whence could it have proceeded that the athenians a people who
 would not suffer an army to be commanded by fewer than ten generals
 and who required no other proof of danger to their liberties than
 the illustrious merit of a fellowcitizen should consider one
 illustrious citizen as a more eligible depositary of the fortunes of
 themselves and their posterity than a select body of citizens from
 whose common deliberations more wisdom as well as more safety
 might have been expected these questions cannot be fully answered
 without supposing that the fears of discord and disunion among a
 number of counsellors exceeded the apprehension of treachery or
 incapacity in a single individual history informs us likewise of
 the difficulties with which these celebrated reformers had to
 contend as well as the expedients which they were obliged to employ
 in order to carry their reforms into effect solon who seems to
 have indulged a more temporizing policy confessed that he had not
 given to his countrymen the government best suited to their
 happiness but most tolerable to their prejudices and lycurgus
 more true to his object was under the necessity of mixing a portion
 of violence with the authority of superstition and of securing his
 final success by a voluntary renunciation first of his country and
 then of his life if these lessons teach us on one hand to admire
 the improvement made by america on the ancient mode of preparing and
 establishing regular plans of government they serve not less on
 the other to admonish us of the hazards and difficulties incident
 to such experiments and of the great imprudence of unnecessarily
 multiplying them
is it an unreasonable conjecture that the errors which may be
 contained in the plan of the convention are such as have resulted
 rather from the defect of antecedent experience on this complicated
 and difficult subject than from a want of accuracy or care in the
 investigation of it and consequently such as will not be
 ascertained until an actual trial shall have pointed them out this
 conjecture is rendered probable not only by many considerations of
 a general nature but by the particular case of the articles of
 confederation it is observable that among the numerous objections
 and amendments suggested by the several states when these articles
 were submitted for their ratification not one is found which
 alludes to the great and radical error which on actual trial has
 discovered itself and if we except the observations which new
 jersey was led to make rather by her local situation than by her
 peculiar foresight it may be questioned whether a single suggestion
 was of sufficient moment to justify a revision of the system there
 is abundant reason nevertheless to suppose that immaterial as
 these objections were they would have been adhered to with a very
 dangerous inflexibility in some states had not a zeal for their
 opinions and supposed interests been stifled by the more powerful
 sentiment of selfpreservation one state we may remember
 persisted for several years in refusing her concurrence although
 the enemy remained the whole period at our gates or rather in the
 very bowels of our country nor was her pliancy in the end effected
 by a less motive than the fear of being chargeable with protracting
 the public calamities and endangering the event of the contest
 every candid reader will make the proper reflections on these
 important facts
a patient who finds his disorder daily growing worse and that
 an efficacious remedy can no longer be delayed without extreme
 danger after coolly revolving his situation and the characters of
 different physicians selects and calls in such of them as he judges
 most capable of administering relief and best entitled to his
 confidence the physicians attend the case of the patient is
 carefully examined a consultation is held they are unanimously
 agreed that the symptoms are critical but that the case with
 proper and timely relief is so far from being desperate that it
 may be made to issue in an improvement of his constitution they
 are equally unanimous in prescribing the remedy by which this happy
 effect is to be produced the prescription is no sooner made known
 however than a number of persons interpose and without denying
 the reality or danger of the disorder assure the patient that the
 prescription will be poison to his constitution and forbid him
 under pain of certain death to make use of it might not the
 patient reasonably demand before he ventured to follow this advice
 that the authors of it should at least agree among themselves on
 some other remedy to be substituted and if he found them differing
 as much from one another as from his first counsellors would he not
 act prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by
 the latter rather than be hearkening to those who could neither
 deny the necessity of a speedy remedy nor agree in proposing one
such a patient and in such a situation is america at this moment
 she has been sensible of her malady she has obtained a regular
 and unanimous advice from men of her own deliberate choice and she
 is warned by others against following this advice under pain of the
 most fatal consequences do the monitors deny the reality of her
 danger no do they deny the necessity of some speedy and powerful
 remedy no are they agreed are any two of them agreed in their
 objections to the remedy proposed or in the proper one to be
 substituted let them speak for themselves this one tells us that
 the proposed constitution ought to be rejected because it is not a
 confederation of the states but a government over individuals
 another admits that it ought to be a government over individuals to
 a certain extent but by no means to the extent proposed a third
 does not object to the government over individuals or to the extent
 proposed but to the want of a bill of rights a fourth concurs in
 the absolute necessity of a bill of rights but contends that it
 ought to be declaratory not of the personal rights of individuals
 but of the rights reserved to the states in their political capacity
 a fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any sort would be
 superfluous and misplaced and that the plan would be
 unexceptionable but for the fatal power of regulating the times and
 places of election an objector in a large state exclaims loudly
 against the unreasonable equality of representation in the senate
 an objector in a small state is equally loud against the dangerous
 inequality in the house of representatives from this quarter we
 are alarmed with the amazing expense from the number of persons who
 are to administer the new government from another quarter and
 sometimes from the same quarter on another occasion the cry is
 that the congress will be but a shadow of a representation and that
 the government would be far less objectionable if the number and the
 expense were doubled a patriot in a state that does not import or
 export discerns insuperable objections against the power of direct
 taxation the patriotic adversary in a state of great exports and
 imports is not less dissatisfied that the whole burden of taxes may
 be thrown on consumption this politician discovers in the
 constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy that
 is equally sure it will end in aristocracy another is puzzled to
 say which of these shapes it will ultimately assume but sees
 clearly it must be one or other of them whilst a fourth is not
 wanting who with no less confidence affirms that the constitution
 is so far from having a bias towards either of these dangers that
 the weight on that side will not be sufficient to keep it upright
 and firm against its opposite propensities with another class of
 adversaries to the constitution the language is that the
 legislative executive and judiciary departments are intermixed in
 such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government
 and all the requisite precautions in favor of liberty whilst this
 objection circulates in vague and general expressions there are but
 a few who lend their sanction to it let each one come forward with
 his particular explanation and scarce any two are exactly agreed
 upon the subject in the eyes of one the junction of the senate
 with the president in the responsible function of appointing to
 offices instead of vesting this executive power in the executive
 alone is the vicious part of the organization to another the
 exclusion of the house of representatives whose numbers alone could
 be a due security against corruption and partiality in the exercise
 of such a power is equally obnoxious with another the admission
 of the president into any share of a power which ever must be a
 dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magistrate is an
 unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealousy no
 part of the arrangement according to some is more inadmissible
 than the trial of impeachments by the senate which is alternately a
 member both of the legislative and executive departments when this
 power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department we
 concur fully reply others in the objection to this part of the
 plan but we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the
 judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error our
 principal dislike to the organization arises from the extensive
 powers already lodged in that department even among the zealous
 patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable variance is
 discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be constituted
 the demand of one gentleman is that the council should consist of
 a small number to be appointed by the most numerous branch of the
 legislature another would prefer a larger number and considers it
 as a fundamental condition that the appointment should be made by
 the president himself
as it can give no umbrage to the writers against the plan of the
 federal constitution let us suppose that as they are the most
 zealous so they are also the most sagacious of those who think the
 late convention were unequal to the task assigned them and that a
 wiser and better plan might and ought to be substituted let us
 further suppose that their country should concur both in this
 favorable opinion of their merits and in their unfavorable opinion
 of the convention and should accordingly proceed to form them into
 a second convention with full powers and for the express purpose
 of revising and remoulding the work of the first were the
 experiment to be seriously made though it required some effort to
 view it seriously even in fiction i leave it to be decided by the
 sample of opinions just exhibited whether with all their enmity to
 their predecessors they would in any one point depart so widely
 from their example as in the discord and ferment that would mark
 their own deliberations and whether the constitution now before
 the public would not stand as fair a chance for immortality as
 lycurgus gave to that of sparta by making its change to depend on
 his own return from exile and death if it were to be immediately
 adopted and were to continue in force not until a better but
 until another should be agreed upon by this new assembly of
 lawgivers
it is a matter both of wonder and regret that those who raise
 so many objections against the new constitution should never call to
 mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it it is not
 necessary that the former should be perfect it is sufficient that
 the latter is more imperfect no man would refuse to give brass for
 silver or gold because the latter had some alloy in it no man
 would refuse to quit a shattered and tottering habitation for a firm
 and commodious building because the latter had not a porch to it
 or because some of the rooms might be a little larger or smaller or
 the ceilings a little higher or lower than his fancy would have
 planned them but waiving illustrations of this sort is it not
 manifest that most of the capital objections urged against the new
 system lie with tenfold weight against the existing confederation
 is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of the
 federal government the present congress can make requisitions to
 any amount they please and the states are constitutionally bound to
 furnish them they can emit bills of credit as long as they will
 pay for the paper they can borrow both abroad and at home as
 long as a shilling will be lent is an indefinite power to raise
 troops dangerous the confederation gives to congress that power
 also and they have already begun to make use of it is it
 improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government
 in the same body of men congress a single body of men are the
 sole depositary of all the federal powers is it particularly
 dangerous to give the keys of the treasury and the command of the
 army into the same hands the confederation places them both in
 the hands of congress is a bill of rights essential to liberty
 the confederation has no bill of rights is it an objection
 against the new constitution that it empowers the senate with the
 concurrence of the executive to make treaties which are to be the
 laws of the land the existing congress without any such control
 can make treaties which they themselves have declared and most of
 the states have recognized to be the supreme law of the land is
 the importation of slaves permitted by the new constitution for
 twenty years by the old it is permitted forever
i shall be told that however dangerous this mixture of powers
 may be in theory it is rendered harmless by the dependence of
 congress on the state for the means of carrying them into practice
 that however large the mass of powers may be it is in fact a
 lifeless mass then say i in the first place that the
 confederation is chargeable with the still greater folly of
 declaring certain powers in the federal government to be absolutely
 necessary and at the same time rendering them absolutely nugatory
 and in the next place that if the union is to continue and no
 better government be substituted effective powers must either be
 granted to or assumed by the existing congress in either of
 which events the contrast just stated will hold good but this is
 not all out of this lifeless mass has already grown an excrescent
 power which tends to realize all the dangers that can be
 apprehended from a defective construction of the supreme government
 of the union it is now no longer a point of speculation and hope
 that the western territory is a mine of vast wealth to the united
 states and although it is not of such a nature as to extricate
 them from their present distresses or for some time to come to
 yield any regular supplies for the public expenses yet must it
 hereafter be able under proper management both to effect a gradual
 discharge of the domestic debt and to furnish for a certain
 period liberal tributes to the federal treasury a very large
 proportion of this fund has been already surrendered by individual
 states and it may with reason be expected that the remaining
 states will not persist in withholding similar proofs of their
 equity and generosity we may calculate therefore that a rich and
 fertile country of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the
 united states will soon become a national stock congress have
 assumed the administration of this stock they have begun to render
 it productive congress have undertaken to do more they have
 proceeded to form new states to erect temporary governments to
 appoint officers for them and to prescribe the conditions on which
 such states shall be admitted into the confederacy all this has
 been done and done without the least color of constitutional
 authority yet no blame has been whispered no alarm has been
 sounded a great and independent fund of revenue is passing into
 the hands of a single body of men who can raise troops to an
 indefinite number and appropriate money to their support for an
 indefinite period of time and yet there are men who have not only
 been silent spectators of this prospect but who are advocates for
 the system which exhibits it and at the same time urge against
 the new system the objections which we have heard would they not
 act with more consistency in urging the establishment of the
 latter as no less necessary to guard the union against the future
 powers and resources of a body constructed like the existing
 congress than to save it from the dangers threatened by the present
 impotency of that assembly
i mean not by any thing here said to throw censure on the
 measures which have been pursued by congress i am sensible they
 could not have done otherwise the public interest the necessity
 of the case imposed upon them the task of overleaping their
 constitutional limits but is not the fact an alarming proof of the
 danger resulting from a government which does not possess regular
 powers commensurate to its objects a dissolution or usurpation is
 the dreadful dilemma to which it is continually exposed
publius
federalist no 
the conformity of the plan to republican principles
for the independent journal
madison
to the people of the state of new york
the last paper having concluded the observations which were
 meant to introduce a candid survey of the plan of government
 reported by the convention we now proceed to the execution of that
 part of our undertaking
the first question that offers itself is whether the general
 form and aspect of the government be strictly republican it is
 evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of
 the people of america with the fundamental principles of the
 revolution or with that honorable determination which animates
 every votary of freedom to rest all our political experiments on
 the capacity of mankind for selfgovernment if the plan of the
 convention therefore be found to depart from the republican
 character its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible
what then are the distinctive characters of the republican
 form were an answer to this question to be sought not by
 recurring to principles but in the application of the term by
 political writers to the constitution of different states no
 satisfactory one would ever be found holland in which no particle
 of the supreme authority is derived from the people has passed
 almost universally under the denomination of a republic the same
 title has been bestowed on venice where absolute power over the
 great body of the people is exercised in the most absolute manner
 by a small body of hereditary nobles poland which is a mixture of
 aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms has been dignified
 with the same appellation the government of england which has one
 republican branch only combined with an hereditary aristocracy and
 monarchy has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the
 list of republics these examples which are nearly as dissimilar
 to each other as to a genuine republic show the extreme inaccuracy
 with which the term has been used in political disquisitions
if we resort for a criterion to the different principles on
 which different forms of government are established we may define a
 republic to be or at least may bestow that name on a government
 which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great
 body of the people and is administered by persons holding their
 offices during pleasure for a limited period or during good
 behavior it is essential to such a government that it be derived
 from the great body of the society not from an inconsiderable
 proportion or a favored class of it otherwise a handful of
 tyrannical nobles exercising their oppressions by a delegation of
 their powers might aspire to the rank of republicans and claim for
 their government the honorable title of republic it is sufficient
 for such a government that the persons administering it be
 appointed either directly or indirectly by the people and that
 they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just
 specified otherwise every government in the united states as well
 as every other popular government that has been or can be well
 organized or well executed would be degraded from the republican
 character according to the constitution of every state in the
 union some or other of the officers of government are appointed
 indirectly only by the people according to most of them the chief
 magistrate himself is so appointed and according to one this mode
 of appointment is extended to one of the coordinate branches of the
 legislature according to all the constitutions also the tenure
 of the highest offices is extended to a definite period and in many
 instances both within the legislative and executive departments to
 a period of years according to the provisions of most of the
 constitutions again as well as according to the most respectable
 and received opinions on the subject the members of the judiciary
 department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good
 behavior
on comparing the constitution planned by the convention with the
 standard here fixed we perceive at once that it is in the most
 rigid sense conformable to it the house of representatives like
 that of one branch at least of all the state legislatures is
 elected immediately by the great body of the people the senate
 like the present congress and the senate of maryland derives its
 appointment indirectly from the people the president is indirectly
 derived from the choice of the people according to the example in
 most of the states even the judges with all other officers of the
 union will as in the several states be the choice though a
 remote choice of the people themselves the duration of the
 appointments is equally conformable to the republican standard and
 to the model of state constitutions the house of representatives is
 periodically elective as in all the states and for the period of
 two years as in the state of south carolina the senate is
 elective for the period of six years which is but one year more
 than the period of the senate of maryland and but two more than
 that of the senates of new york and virginia the president is to
 continue in office for the period of four years as in new york and
 delaware the chief magistrate is elected for three years and in
 south carolina for two years in the other states the election is
 annual in several of the states however no constitutional
 provision is made for the impeachment of the chief magistrate and
 in delaware and virginia he is not impeachable till out of office
 the president of the united states is impeachable at any time
 during his continuance in office the tenure by which the judges
 are to hold their places is as it unquestionably ought to be that
 of good behavior the tenure of the ministerial offices generally
 will be a subject of legal regulation conformably to the reason of
 the case and the example of the state constitutions
could any further proof be required of the republican complexion
 of this system the most decisive one might be found in its absolute
 prohibition of titles of nobility both under the federal and the
 state governments and in its express guaranty of the republican
 form to each of the latter
but it was not sufficient say the adversaries of the
 proposed constitution for the convention to adhere to the
 republican form they ought with equal care to have preserved the
 federal form which regards the union as a confederacy of sovereign
 states instead of which they have framed a national government
 which regards the union as a consolidation of the states and it
 is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was
 undertaken the handle which has been made of this objection
 requires that it should be examined with some precision
without inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which
 the objection is founded it will be necessary to a just estimate of
 its force first to ascertain the real character of the government
 in question secondly to inquire how far the convention were
 authorized to propose such a government and thirdly how far the
 duty they owed to their country could supply any defect of regular
 authority
first in order to ascertain the real character of the
 government it may be considered in relation to the foundation on
 which it is to be established to the sources from which its
 ordinary powers are to be drawn to the operation of those powers
 to the extent of them and to the authority by which future
 changes in the government are to be introduced
on examining the first relation it appears on one hand that
 the constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of
 the people of america given by deputies elected for the special
 purpose but on the other that this assent and ratification is to
 be given by the people not as individuals composing one entire
 nation but as composing the distinct and independent states to
 which they respectively belong it is to be the assent and
 ratification of the several states derived from the supreme
 authority in each state the authority of the people themselves
 the act therefore establishing the constitution will not be a
 national but a federal act
that it will be a federal and not a national act as these terms
 are understood by the objectors the act of the people as forming
 so many independent states not as forming one aggregate nation is
 obvious from this single consideration that it is to result neither
 from the decision of a majority of the people of the union nor from
 that of a majority of the states it must result from the unanimous
 assent of the several states that are parties to it differing no
 otherwise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed
 not by the legislative authority but by that of the people
 themselves were the people regarded in this transaction as forming
 one nation the will of the majority of the whole people of the
 united states would bind the minority in the same manner as the
 majority in each state must bind the minority and the will of the
 majority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual
 votes or by considering the will of the majority of the states as
 evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the united
 states neither of these rules have been adopted each state in
 ratifying the constitution is considered as a sovereign body
 independent of all others and only to be bound by its own voluntary
 act in this relation then the new constitution will if
 established be a federal and not a national constitution
the next relation is to the sources from which the ordinary
 powers of government are to be derived the house of
 representatives will derive its powers from the people of america
 and the people will be represented in the same proportion and on
 the same principle as they are in the legislature of a particular
 state so far the government is national not federal the senate
 on the other hand will derive its powers from the states as
 political and coequal societies and these will be represented on
 the principle of equality in the senate as they now are in the
 existing congress so far the government is federal not national
 the executive power will be derived from a very compound source
 the immediate election of the president is to be made by the states
 in their political characters the votes allotted to them are in a
 compound ratio which considers them partly as distinct and coequal
 societies partly as unequal members of the same society the
 eventual election again is to be made by that branch of the
 legislature which consists of the national representatives but in
 this particular act they are to be thrown into the form of
 individual delegations from so many distinct and coequal bodies
 politic from this aspect of the government it appears to be of a
 mixed character presenting at least as many federal as national
 features
the difference between a federal and national government as it
 relates to the operation of the government is supposed to consist
 in this that in the former the powers operate on the political
 bodies composing the confederacy in their political capacities in
 the latter on the individual citizens composing the nation in
 their individual capacities on trying the constitution by this
 criterion it falls under the national not the federal character
 though perhaps not so completely as has been understood in
 several cases and particularly in the trial of controversies to
 which states may be parties they must be viewed and proceeded
 against in their collective and political capacities only so far
 the national countenance of the government on this side seems to be
 disfigured by a few federal features but this blemish is perhaps
 unavoidable in any plan and the operation of the government on the
 people in their individual capacities in its ordinary and most
 essential proceedings may on the whole designate it in this
 relation a national government
but if the government be national with regard to the operation
 of its powers it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in
 relation to the extent of its powers the idea of a national
 government involves in it not only an authority over the individual
 citizens but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things
 so far as they are objects of lawful government among a people
 consolidated into one nation this supremacy is completely vested in
 the national legislature among communities united for particular
 purposes it is vested partly in the general and partly in the
 municipal legislatures in the former case all local authorities
 are subordinate to the supreme and may be controlled directed or
 abolished by it at pleasure in the latter the local or municipal
 authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy
 no more subject within their respective spheres to the general
 authority than the general authority is subject to them within its
 own sphere in this relation then the proposed government cannot
 be deemed a national one since its jurisdiction extends to certain
 enumerated objects only and leaves to the several states a
 residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects it is
 true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two
 jurisdictions the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be
 established under the general government but this does not change
 the principle of the case the decision is to be impartially made
 according to the rules of the constitution and all the usual and
 most effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality
 some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the
 sword and a dissolution of the compact and that it ought to be
 established under the general rather than under the local
 governments or to speak more properly that it could be safely
 established under the first alone is a position not likely to be
 combated
if we try the constitution by its last relation to the authority
 by which amendments are to be made we find it neither wholly
 national nor wholly federal were it wholly national the supreme
 and ultimate authority would reside in the majority of the people of
 the union and this authority would be competent at all times like
 that of a majority of every national society to alter or abolish
 its established government were it wholly federal on the other
 hand the concurrence of each state in the union would be essential
 to every alteration that would be binding on all the mode provided
 by the plan of the convention is not founded on either of these
 principles in requiring more than a majority and principles in
 requiring more than a majority and particularly in computing the
 proportion by states not by citizens it departs from the national
 and advances towards the federal character in rendering the
 concurrence of less than the whole number of states sufficient it
 loses again the federal and partakes of the national character
the proposed constitution therefore is in strictness neither
 a national nor a federal constitution but a composition of both
 in its foundation it is federal not national in the sources from
 which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn it is partly
 federal and partly national in the operation of these powers it
 is national not federal in the extent of them again it is
 federal not national and finally in the authoritative mode of
 introducing amendments it is neither wholly federal nor wholly
 national

the powers of the convention to form a mixed government examined
and sustained
from the new york packet 
friday january   
madison
to the people of the state of new york
the second point to be examined is whether the convention were
authorized to frame and propose this mixed constitution the
powers of the convention ought in strictness to be determined
by an inspection of the commissions given to the members by their
respective constituents as all of these however had reference
either to the recommendation from the meeting at annapolis in
september  or to that from congress in february  it
will be sufficient to recur to these particular acts the act
from annapolis recommends the appointment of commissioners to
take into consideration the situation of the united states to
devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary
to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to
the exigencies of the union and to report such an act for that
purpose to the united states in congress assembled as when
agreed to by them and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of
every state will effectually provide for the same the
recommendatory act of congress is in the words
followingwhereas there is provision in the articles of
confederation and perpetual union for making alterations
therein by the assent of a congress of the united states and of
the legislatures of the several states and whereas experience
hath evinced that there are defects in the present
confederation as a mean to remedy which several of the states
and particularly the state of new york by express instructions
to their delegates in congress have suggested a convention for
the purposes expressed in the following resolution and such
convention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing
in these states a firm national governmentresolved that in
the opinion of congress it is expedient that on the second
monday of may next a convention of delegates who shall have been
appointed by the several states be held at philadelphia for the
sole and express purpose of revising the articles of
confederation and reporting to congress and the several
legislatures such alterations and provisions therein as shall
when agreed to in congress and confirmed by the states render
the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government
and the preservation of the union from these two acts it
appears st that the object of the convention was to establish
in these states a firm national government d that this
government was to be such as would be adequate to the exigencies
of government and the preservation of the union d that these
purposes were to be effected by alterations and provisions in the
articles of confederation as it is expressed in the act of
congress or by such further provisions as should appear
necessary as it stands in the recommendatory act from annapolis
th that the alterations and provisions were to be reported to
congress and to the states in order to be agreed to by the
former and confirmed by the latter from a comparison and fair
construction of these several modes of expression is to be
deduced the authority under which the convention acted they were
to frame a national government adequate to the exigencies of
government and of the union and to reduce the articles of
confederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes
there are two rules of construction dictated by plain reason as
well as founded on legal axioms the one is that every part of
the expression ought if possible to be allowed some meaning
and be made to conspire to some common end the other is that
where the several parts cannot be made to coincide the less
important should give way to the more important part the means
should be sacrificed to the end rather than the end to the
means suppose then that the expressions defining the
authority of the convention were irreconcilably at variance with
each other that a national and adequate government could not
possibly in the judgment of the convention be affected by
alterations and provisions in the articles of confederation
which part of the definition ought to have been embraced and
which rejected which was the more important which the less
important part which the end which the means let the most
scrupulous expositors of delegated powers let the most
inveterate objectors against those exercised by the convention
answer these questions let them declare whether it was of most
importance to the happiness of the people of america that the
articles of confederation should be disregarded and an adequate
government be provided and the union preserved or that an
adequate government should be omitted and the articles of
confederation preserved let them declare whether the
preservation of these articles was the end for securing which a
reform of the government was to be introduced as the means or
whether the establishment of a government adequate to the
national happiness was the end at which these articles
themselves originally aimed and to which they ought as
insufficient means to have been sacrificed but is it necessary
to suppose that these expressions are absolutely irreconcilable
to each other that no alterations or provisions in the articles
of the confederation could possibly mould them into a national
and adequate government into such a government as has been
proposed by the convention no stress it is presumed will in
this case be laid on the title a change of that could never be
deemed an exercise of ungranted power alterations in the body of
the instrument are expressly authorized new provisions therein
are also expressly authorized here then is a power to change the
title to insert new articles to alter old ones must it of
necessity be admitted that this power is infringed so long as a
part of the old articles remain those who maintain the
affirmative ought at least to mark the boundary between
authorized and usurped innovations between that degree of change
which lies within the compass of alterations and further
provisions and that which amounts to a transmutation of the
government will it be said that the alterations ought not to
have touched the substance of the confederation the states
would never have appointed a convention with so much solemnity
nor described its objects with so much latitude if some
substantial reform had not been in contemplation will it be said
that the fundamental principles of the confederation were not
within the purview of the convention and ought not to have been
varied i ask what are these principles do they require that
in the establishment of the constitution the states should be
regarded as distinct and independent sovereigns they are so
regarded by the constitution proposed do they require that the
members of the government should derive their appointment from
the legislatures not from the people of the states one branch
of the new government is to be appointed by these legislatures
and under the confederation the delegates to congress may all
be appointed immediately by the people and in two states are
actually so appointed do they require that the powers of the
government should act on the states and not immediately on
individuals in some instances as has been shown the powers of
the new government will act on the states in their collective
characters in some instances also those of the existing
government act immediately on individuals in cases of capture
of piracy of the post office of coins weights and measures
of trade with the indians of claims under grants of land by
different states and above all in the case of trials by
courtsmarshal in the army and navy by which death may be
inflicted without the intervention of a jury or even of a civil
magistrate in all these cases the powers of the confederation
operate immediately on the persons and interests of individual
citizens do these fundamental principles require particularly
that no tax should be levied without the intermediate agency of
the states the confederation itself authorizes a direct tax to
a certain extent on the post office the power of coinage has
been so construed by congress as to levy a tribute immediately
from that source also but pretermitting these instances was it
not an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal
expectation of the people that the regulation of trade should be
submitted to the general government in such a form as would
render it an immediate source of general revenue had not
congress repeatedly recommended this measure as not inconsistent
with the fundamental principles of the confederation had not
every state but one had not new york herself so far complied
with the plan of congress as to recognize the principle of the
innovation do these principles in fine require that the
powers of the general government should be limited and that
beyond this limit the states should be left in possession of
their sovereignty and independence we have seen that in the new
government as in the old the general powers are limited and
that the states in all unenumerated cases are left in the
enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction the
truth is that the great principles of the constitution proposed
by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new than
as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of
confederation the misfortune under the latter system has been
that these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify
all the charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it
and to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new
system the aspect of an entire transformation of the old in one
particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from
the tenor of their commission instead of reporting a plan
requiring the confirmation of the legislatures of all the states
they have reported a plan which is to be confirmed by the people
and may be carried into effect by nine states only it is worthy
of remark that this objection though the most plausible has
been the least urged in the publications which have swarmed
against the convention the forbearance can only have proceeded
from an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting
the fate of twelve states to the perverseness or corruption of a
thirteenth from the example of inflexible opposition given by a
majority of one sixtieth of the people of america to a measure
approved and called for by the voice of twelve states comprising
fiftynine sixtieths of the people an example still fresh in the
memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the
wounded honor and prosperity of his country as this objection
therefore has been in a manner waived by those who have
criticised the powers of the convention i dismiss it without
further observation the third point to be inquired into is how
far considerations of duty arising out of the case itself could
have supplied any defect of regular authority in the preceding
inquiries the powers of the convention have been analyzed and
tried with the same rigor and by the same rules as if they had
been real and final powers for the establishment of a
constitution for the united states we have seen in what manner
they have borne the trial even on that supposition it is time
now to recollect that the powers were merely advisory and
recommendatory that they were so meant by the states and so
understood by the convention and that the latter have
accordingly planned and proposed a constitution which is to be of
no more consequence than the paper on which it is written unless
it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom it is
addressed this reflection places the subject in a point of view
altogether different and will enable us to judge with propriety
of the course taken by the convention let us view the ground on
which the convention stood it may be collected from their
proceedings that they were deeply and unanimously impressed with
the crisis which had led their country almost with one voice to
make so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the
errors of a system by which this crisis had been produced that
they were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a
reform as they have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect
the purposes of their appointment it could not be unknown to
them that the hopes and expectations of the great body of
citizens throughout this great empire were turned with the
keenest anxiety to the event of their deliberations they had
every reason to believe that the contrary sentiments agitated the
minds and bosoms of every external and internal foe to the
liberty and prosperity of the united states they had seen in the
origin and progress of the experiment the alacrity with which
the proposition made by a single state virginia towards a
partial amendment of the confederation had been attended to and
promoted they had seen the liberty assumed by a very few
deputies from a very few states convened at annapolis of
recommending a great and critical object wholly foreign to their
commission not only justified by the public opinion but
actually carried into effect by twelve out of the thirteen
states they had seen in a variety of instances assumptions by
congress not only of recommendatory but of operative powers
warranted in the public estimation by occasions and objects
infinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to
be governed they must have reflected that in all great changes
of established governments forms ought to give way to substance
that a rigid adherence in such cases to the former would render
nominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the
people to abolish or alter their governments as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness since
it is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally to
move in concert towards their object and it is therefore
essential that such changes be instituted by some informal and
unauthorized propositions made by some patriotic and respectable
citizen or number of citizens they must have recollected that it
was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the
people plans for their safety and happiness that the states
were first united against the danger with which they were
threatened by their ancient government that committees and
congresses were formed for concentrating their efforts and
defending their rights and that conventions were elected in the
several states for establishing the constitutions under which
they are now governed nor could it have been forgotten that no
little illtimed scruples no zeal for adhering to ordinary
forms were anywhere seen except in those who wished to indulge
under these masks their secret enmity to the substance contended
for they must have borne in mind that as the plan to be framed
and proposed was to be submitted to the people themselves the
disapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it
forever its approbation blot out antecedent errors and
irregularities it might even have occurred to them that where a
disposition to cavil prevailed their neglect to execute the
degree of power vested in them and still more their
recommendation of any measure whatever not warranted by their
commission would not less excite animadversion than a
recommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the
national exigencies had the convention under all these
impressions and in the midst of all these considerations
instead of exercising a manly confidence in their country by
whose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished and
of pointing out a system capable in their judgment of securing
its happiness taken the cold and sullen resolution of
disappointing its ardent hopes of sacrificing substance to
forms of committing the dearest interests of their country to
the uncertainties of delay and the hazard of events let me ask
the man who can raise his mind to one elevated conception who
can awaken in his bosom one patriotic emotion what judgment
ought to have been pronounced by the impartial world by the
friends of mankind by every virtuous citizen on the conduct and
character of this assembly or if there be a man whose
propensity to condemn is susceptible of no control let me then
ask what sentence he has in reserve for the twelve states who
usurped the power of sending deputies to the convention a body
utterly unknown to their constitutions for congress who
recommended the appointment of this body equally unknown to the
confederation and for the state of new york in particular
which first urged and then complied with this unauthorized
interposition but that the objectors may be disarmed of every
pretext it shall be granted for a moment that the convention
were neither authorized by their commission nor justified by
circumstances in proposing a constitution for their country does
it follow that the constitution ought for that reason alone to
be rejected if according to the noble precept it be lawful to
accept good advice even from an enemy shall we set the ignoble
example of refusing such advice even when it is offered by our
friends the prudent inquiry in all cases ought surely to be
not so much from whom the advice comes as whether the advice be
good the sum of what has been here advanced and proved is that
the charge against the convention of exceeding their powers
except in one instance little urged by the objectors has no
foundation to support it that if they had exceeded their powers
they were not only warranted but required as the confidential
servants of their country by the circumstances in which they
were placed to exercise the liberty which they assume and that
finally if they had violated both their powers and their
obligations in proposing a constitution this ought nevertheless
to be embraced if it be calculated to accomplish the views and
happiness of the people of america how far this character is due
to the constitution is the subject under investigation publius

general view of the powers conferred by the constitution
for the independent journal 
madison
to the people of the state of new york
the constitution proposed by the convention may be considered
under two general points of view the first relates to the sum or
quantity of power which it vests in the government including
the restraints imposed on the states the second to the
particular structure of the government and the distribution of
this power among its several branches under the first view of
the subject two important questions arise  whether any part
of the powers transferred to the general government be
unnecessary or improper  whether the entire mass of them be
dangerous to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several
states is the aggregate power of the general government greater
than ought to have been vested in it this is the first
question it cannot have escaped those who have attended with
candor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of
the government that the authors of them have very little
considered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining
a necessary end they have chosen rather to dwell on the
inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all
political advantages and on the possible abuses which must be
incident to every power or trust of which a beneficial use can
be made this method of handling the subject cannot impose on the
good sense of the people of america it may display the subtlety
of the writer it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and
declamation it may inflame the passions of the unthinking and
may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking but cool and
candid people will at once reflect that the purest of human
blessings must have a portion of alloy in them that the choice
must always be made if not of the lesser evil at least of the
greater not the perfect good and that in every political
institution a power to advance the public happiness involves a
discretion which may be misapplied and abused they will see
therefore that in all cases where power is to be conferred the
point first to be decided is whether such a power be necessary
to the public good as the next will be in case of an
affirmative decision to guard as effectually as possible
against a perversion of the power to the public detriment that
we may form a correct judgment on this subject it will be proper
to review the several powers conferred on the government of the
union and that this may be the more conveniently done they may
be reduced into different classes as they relate to the following
different objects  security against foreign danger 
regulation of the intercourse with foreign nations 
maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the states
 certain miscellaneous objects of general utility 
restraint of the states from certain injurious acts 
provisions for giving due efficacy to all these powers the
powers falling within the first class are those of declaring war
and granting letters of marque of providing armies and fleets
of regulating and calling forth the militia of levying and
borrowing money security against foreign danger is one of the
primitive objects of civil society it is an avowed and essential
object of the american union the powers requisite for attaining
it must be effectually confided to the federal councils is the
power of declaring war necessary no man will answer this
question in the negative it would be superfluous therefore to
enter into a proof of the affirmative the existing confederation
establishes this power in the most ample form is the power of
raising armies and equipping fleets necessary this is involved
in the foregoing power it is involved in the power of
selfdefense but was it necessary to give an indefinite power
of raising troops as well as providing fleets and of
maintaining both in peace as well as in war the answer to these
questions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit
an extensive discussion of them in this place the answer indeed
seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such
a discussion in any place with what color of propriety could the
force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit
the force of offense if a federal constitution could chain the
ambition or set bounds to the exertions of all other nations
then indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own
government and set bounds to the exertions for its own safety
how could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely
prohibited unless we could prohibit in like manner the
preparations and establishments of every hostile nation the
means of security can only be regulated by the means and the
danger of attack they will in fact be ever determined by these
rules and by no others it is in vain to oppose constitutional
barriers to the impulse of selfpreservation it is worse than in
vain because it plants in the constitution itself necessary
usurpations of power every precedent of which is a germ of
unnecessary and multiplied repetitions if one nation maintains
constantly a disciplined army ready for the service of ambition
or revenge it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within
the reach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions
the fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military
establishments in the time of peace they were introduced by
charles vii of france all europe has followed or been forced
into the example had the example not been followed by other
nations all europe must long ago have worn the chains of a
universal monarch were every nation except france now to disband
its peace establishments the same event might follow the
veteran legions of rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined
valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the
world not the less true is it that the liberties of rome
proved the final victim to her military triumphs and that the
liberties of europe as far as they ever existed have with few
exceptions been the price of her military establishments a
standing force therefore is a dangerous at the same time that
it may be a necessary provision on the smallest scale it has
its inconveniences on an extensive scale its consequences may be
fatal on any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection
and precaution a wise nation will combine all these
considerations and whilst it does not rashly preclude itself
from any resource which may become essential to its safety will
exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the
danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its
liberties the clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on
the proposed constitution the union itself which it cements and
secures destroys every pretext for a military establishment
which could be dangerous america united with a handful of
troops or without a single soldier exhibits a more forbidding
posture to foreign ambition than america disunited with a
hundred thousand veterans ready for combat it was remarked on a
former occasion that the want of this pretext had saved the
liberties of one nation in europe being rendered by her insular
situation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of
her neighbors the rulers of great britain have never been able
by real or artificial dangers to cheat the public into an
extensive peace establishment the distance of the united states
from the powerful nations of the world gives them the same happy
security a dangerous establishment can never be necessary or
plausible so long as they continue a united people but let it
never for a moment be forgotten that they are indebted for this
advantage to the union alone the moment of its dissolution will
be the date of a new order of things the fears of the weaker or
the ambition of the stronger states or confederacies will set
the same example in the new as charles vii did in the old
world the example will be followed here from the same motives
which produced universal imitation there instead of deriving
from our situation the precious advantage which great britain has
derived from hers the face of america will be but a copy of that
of the continent of europe it will present liberty everywhere
crushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes the fortunes
of disunited america will be even more disastrous than those of
europe the sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own
limits no superior powers of another quarter of the globe
intrigue among her rival nations inflame their mutual
animosities and render them the instruments of foreign ambition
jealousy and revenge in america the miseries springing from her
internal jealousies contentions and wars would form a part
only of her lot a plentiful addition of evils would have their
source in that relation in which europe stands to this quarter of
the earth and which no other quarter of the earth bears to
europe this picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be
too highly colored or too often exhibited every man who loves
peace every man who loves his country every man who loves
liberty ought to have it ever before his eyes that he may
cherish in his heart a due attachment to the union of america
and be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it
next to the effectual establishment of the union the best
possible precaution against danger from standing armies is a
limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to
their support this precaution the constitution has prudently
added i will not repeat here the observations which i flatter
myself have placed this subject in a just and satisfactory
light but it may not be improper to take notice of an argument
against this part of the constitution which has been drawn from
the policy and practice of great britain it is said that the
continuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of
the legislature whereas the american constitution has lengthened
this critical period to two years this is the form in which the
comparison is usually stated to the public but is it a just
form is it a fair comparison does the british constitution
restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year does the
american impose on the congress appropriations for two years on
the contrary it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy
themselves that the british constitution fixes no limit whatever
to the discretion of the legislature and that the american ties
down the legislature to two years as the longest admissible
term had the argument from the british example been truly
stated it would have stood thus the term for which supplies
may be appropriated to the army establishment though unlimited
by the british constitution has nevertheless in practice been
limited by parliamentary discretion to a single year now if in
great britain where the house of commons is elected for seven
years where so great a proportion of the members are elected by
so small a proportion of the people where the electors are so
corrupted by the representatives and the representatives so
corrupted by the crown the representative body can possess a
power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term
without desiring or without daring to extend the term beyond a
single year ought not suspicion herself to blush in pretending
that the representatives of the united states elected freely by
the whole body of the people every second year cannot be safely
intrusted with the discretion over such appropriations expressly
limited to the short period of two years a bad cause seldom
fails to betray itself of this truth the management of the
opposition to the federal government is an unvaried
exemplification but among all the blunders which have been
committed none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on
that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the people of
standing armies the attempt has awakened fully the public
attention to that important subject and has led to
investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal
conviction not only that the constitution has provided the most
effectual guards against danger from that quarter but that
nothing short of a constitution fully adequate to the national
defense and the preservation of the union can save america from
as many standing armies as it may be split into states or
confederacies and from such a progressive augmentation of these
establishments in each as will render them as burdensome to the
properties and ominous to the liberties of the people as any
establishment that can become necessary under a united and
efficient government must be tolerable to the former and safe to
the latter the palpable necessity of the power to provide and
maintain a navy has protected that part of the constitution
against a spirit of censure which has spared few other parts it
must indeed be numbered among the greatest blessings of
america that as her union will be the only source of her
maritime strength so this will be a principal source of her
security against danger from abroad in this respect our
situation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of
great britain the batteries most capable of repelling foreign
enterprises on our safety are happily such as can never be
turned by a perfidious government against our liberties the
inhabitants of the atlantic frontier are all of them deeply
interested in this provision for naval protection and if they
have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds if
their property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of
licentious adventurers if their maritime towns have not yet
been compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a
conflagration by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden
invaders these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed
to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of
those from whom it claims allegiance but to causes that are
fugitive and fallacious if we except perhaps virginia and
maryland which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern
frontiers no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety on
this subject than new york her seacoast is extensive a very
important district of the state is an island the state itself is
penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty
leagues the great emporium of its commerce the great reservoir
of its wealth lies every moment at the mercy of events and may
almost be regarded as a hostage for ignominious compliances with
the dictates of a foreign enemy or even with the rapacious
demands of pirates and barbarians should a war be the result of
the precarious situation of european affairs and all the unruly
passions attending it be let loose on the ocean our escape from
insults and depredations not only on that element but every
part of the other bordering on it will be truly miraculous in
the present condition of america the states more immediately
exposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the phantom
of a general government which now exists and if their single
resources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against
the danger the object to be protected would be almost consumed
by the means of protecting them the power of regulating and
calling forth the militia has been already sufficiently
vindicated and explained the power of levying and borrowing
money being the sinew of that which is to be exerted in the
national defense is properly thrown into the same class with
it this power also has been examined already with much
attention and has i trust been clearly shown to be necessary
both in the extent and form given to it by the constitution i
will address one additional reflection only to those who contend
that the power ought to have been restrained to external
taxation by which they mean taxes on articles imported from
other countries it cannot be doubted that this will always be a
valuable source of revenue that for a considerable time it must
be a principal source that at this moment it is an essential
one but we may form very mistaken ideas on this subject if we
do not call to mind in our calculations that the extent of
revenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary with the
variations both in the extent and the kind of imports and that
these variations do not correspond with the progress of
population which must be the general measure of the public
wants as long as agriculture continues the sole field of labor
the importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers
multiply as soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands
not called for by agriculture the imported manufactures will
decrease as the numbers of people increase in a more remote
stage the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw
materials which will be wrought into articles for exportation
and will therefore require rather the encouragement of
bounties than to be loaded with discouraging duties a system of
government meant for duration ought to contemplate these
revolutions and be able to accommodate itself to them some
who have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation have
grounded a very fierce attack against the constitution on the
language in which it is defined it has been urged and echoed
that the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and
excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and
general welfare of the united states amounts to an unlimited
commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be
necessary for the common defense or general welfare no stronger
proof could be given of the distress under which these writers
labor for objections than their stooping to such a
misconstruction had no other enumeration or definition of the
powers of the congress been found in the constitution than the
general expressions just cited the authors of the objection
might have had some color for it though it would have been
difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an
authority to legislate in all possible cases a power to destroy
the freedom of the press the trial by jury or even to regulate
the course of descents or the forms of conveyances must be very
singularly expressed by the terms to raise money for the
general welfare but what color can the objection have when a
specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms
immediately follows and is not even separated by a longer pause
than a semicolon if the different parts of the same instrument
ought to be so expounded as to give meaning to every part which
will bear it shall one part of the same sentence be excluded
altogether from a share in the meaning and shall the more
doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent
and the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification
whatsoever for what purpose could the enumeration of particular
powers be inserted if these and all others were meant to be
included in the preceding general power nothing is more natural
nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to
explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars but the idea
of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor
qualify the general meaning and can have no other effect than to
confound and mislead is an absurdity which as we are reduced
to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection
or on the authors of the constitution we must take the liberty
of supposing had not its origin with the latter the objection
here is the more extraordinary as it appears that the language
used by the convention is a copy from the articles of
confederation the objects of the union among the states as
described in article third are their common defense security
of their liberties and mutual and general welfare  the terms
of article eighth are still more identical all charges of war
and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common
defense or general welfare and allowed by the united states in
congress shall be defrayed out of a common treasury etc a
similar language again occurs in article ninth construe either
of these articles by the rules which would justify the
construction put on the new constitution and they vest in the
existing congress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever
but what would have been thought of that assembly if attaching
themselves to these general expressions and disregarding the
specifications which ascertain and limit their import they had
exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense
and general welfare i appeal to the objectors themselves
whether they would in that case have employed the same reasoning
in justification of congress as they now make use of against the
convention how difficult it is for error to escape its own
condemnation publius

the powers conferred by the constitution further considered
from the new york packet tuesday january   
madison
to the people of the state of new york
the second class of powers lodged in the general government
consists of those which regulate the intercourse with foreign
nations to wit to make treaties to send and receive
ambassadors other public ministers and consuls to define and
punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and
offenses against the law of nations to regulate foreign
commerce including a power to prohibit after the year  the
importation of slaves and to lay an intermediate duty of ten
dollars per head as a discouragement to such importations this
class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the
federal administration if we are to be one nation in any
respect it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations the
powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors
speak their own propriety both of them are comprised in the
articles of confederation with this difference only that the 
former is disembarrassed by the plan of the convention of an
exception under which treaties might be substantially frustrated
by regulations of the states and that a power of appointing and
receiving other public ministers and consuls is expressly
and very properly added to the former provision concerning
ambassadors the term ambassador if taken strictly as seems to
be required by the second of the articles of confederation
comprehends the highest grade only of public ministers and
excludes the grades which the united states will be most likely
to prefer where foreign embassies may be necessary and under no
latitude of construction will the term comprehend consuls yet it
has been found expedient and has been the practice of congress
to employ the inferior grades of public ministers and to send
and receive consuls it is true that where treaties of commerce
stipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls whose functions
are connected with commerce the admission of foreign consuls may
fall within the power of making commercial treaties and that
where no such treaties exist the mission of american consuls
into foreign countries may perhaps be covered under the
authority given by the ninth article of the confederation to
appoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing
the general affairs of the united states but the admission of
consuls into the united states where no previous treaty has
stipulated it seems to have been nowhere provided for a supply
of the omission is one of the lesser instances in which the
convention have improved on the model before them but the most
minute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the
necessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations
of power a list of the cases in which congress have been
betrayed or forced by the defects of the confederation into
violations of their chartered authorities would not a little
surprise those who have paid no attention to the subject and
would be no inconsiderable argument in favor of the new
constitution which seems to have provided no less studiously for
the lesser than the more obvious and striking defects of the
old the power to define and punish piracies and felonies
committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of
nations belongs with equal propriety to the general government
and is a still greater improvement on the articles of
confederation these articles contain no provision for the case
of offenses against the law of nations and consequently leave
it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the
confederacy with foreign nations the provision of the federal
articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no
further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of
these offenses the definition of piracies might perhaps
without inconveniency be left to the law of nations though a
legislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes
a definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently
requisite felony is a term of loose signification even in the
common law of england and of various import in the statute law
of that kingdom but neither the common nor the statute law of
that or of any other nation ought to be a standard for the
proceedings of this unless previously made its own by
legislative adoption the meaning of the term as defined in the
codes of the several states would be as impracticable as the
former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide it is not
precisely the same in any two of the states and varies in each
with every revision of its criminal laws for the sake of
certainty and uniformity therefore the power of defining
felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper
the regulation of foreign commerce having fallen within several
views which have been taken of this subject has been too fully
discussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly
submitted to the federal administration it were doubtless to be
wished that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves
had not been postponed until the year  or rather that it had
been suffered to have immediate operation but it is not
difficult to account either for this restriction on the general
government or for the manner in which the whole clause is
expressed it ought to be considered as a great point gained in
favor of humanity that a period of twenty years may terminate
forever within these states a traffic which has so long and so
loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy that within that
period it will receive a considerable discouragement from the
federal government and may be totally abolished by a
concurrence of the few states which continue the unnatural
traffic in the prohibitory example which has been given by so
great a majority of the union happy would it be for the
unfortunate africans if an equal prospect lay before them of
being redeemed from the oppressions of their european brethren
attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection
against the constitution by representing it on one side as a
criminal toleration of an illicit practice and on another as
calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from
europe to america i mention these misconstructions not with a
view to give them an answer for they deserve none but as
specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit
to conduct their opposition to the proposed government the
powers included in the third class are those which provide for
the harmony and proper intercourse among the states under this
head might be included the particular restraints imposed on the
authority of the states and certain powers of the judicial
department but the former are reserved for a distinct class and
the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the
structure and organization of the government i shall confine
myself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended
under this third description to wit to regulate commerce among
the several states and the indian tribes to coin money regulate
the value thereof and of foreign coin to provide for the
punishment of counterfeiting the current coin and secureties of
the united states to fix the standard of weights and measures
to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and uniform laws
of bankruptcy to prescribe the manner in which the public acts
records and judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved
and the effect they shall have in other states and to establish
post offices and post roads the defect of power in the existing
confederacy to regulate the commerce between its several members
is in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out by
experience to the proofs and remarks which former papers have
brought into view on this subject it may be added that without
this supplemental provision the great and essential power of
regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and
ineffectual a very material object of this power was the relief
of the states which import and export through other states from
the improper contributions levied on them by the latter were
these at liberty to regulate the trade between state and state
it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the
articles of import and export during the passage through their
jurisdiction with duties which would fall on the makers of the
latter and the consumers of the former we may be assured by past
experience that such a practice would be introduced by future
contrivances and both by that and a common knowledge of human
affairs that it would nourish unceasing animosities and not
improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public
tranquillity to those who do not view the question through the
medium of passion or of interest the desire of the commercial
states to collect in any form an indirect revenue from their
uncommercial neighbors must appear not less impolitic than it is
unfair since it would stimulate the injured party by resentment
as well as interest to resort to less convenient channels for
their foreign trade but the mild voice of reason pleading the
cause of an enlarged and permanent interest is but too often
drowned before public bodies as well as individuals by the
clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate
gain the necessity of a superintending authority over the
reciprocal trade of confederated states has been illustrated by
other examples as well as our own in switzerland where the
union is so very slight each canton is obliged to allow to
merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction into other
cantons without an augmentation of the tolls in germany it is a
law of the empire that the princes and states shall not lay
tolls or customs on bridges rivers or passages without the
consent of the emperor and the diet though it appears from a
quotation in an antecedent paper that the practice in this as
in many other instances in that confederacy has not followed the
law and has produced there the mischiefs which have been
foreseen here among the restraints imposed by the union of the
netherlands on its members one is that they shall not establish
imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors without the general
permission the regulation of commerce with the indian tribes is
very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of
confederation which render the provision obscure and
contradictory the power is there restrained to indians not
members of any of the states and is not to violate or infringe
the legislative right of any state within its own limits what
description of indians are to be deemed members of a state is
not yet settled and has been a question of frequent perplexity
and contention in the federal councils and how the trade with
indians though not members of a state yet residing within its
legislative jurisdiction can be regulated by an external
authority without so far intruding on the internal rights of
legislation is absolutely incomprehensible this is not the only
case in which the articles of confederation have inconsiderately
endeavored to accomplish impossibilities to reconcile a partial
sovereignty in the union with complete sovereignty in the
states to subvert a mathematical axiom by taking away a part
and letting the whole remain all that need be remarked on the
power to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign
coin is that by providing for this last case the constitution
has supplied a material omission in the articles of
confederation the authority of the existing congress is
restrained to the regulation of coin struck by their own
authority or that of the respective states it must be seen at
once that the proposed uniformity in the value of the current
coin might be destroyed by subjecting that of foreign coin to the
different regulations of the different states the punishment of
counterfeiting the public securities as well as the current
coin is submitted of course to that authority which is to secure
the value of both the regulation of weights and measures is
transferred from the articles of confederation and is founded on
like considerations with the preceding power of regulating coin
the dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been
remarked as a fault in our system and as laying a foundation for
intricate and delicate questions in the fourth article of the
confederation it is declared that the free inhabitants of each
of these states paupers vagabonds and fugitives from justice
excepted shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of
free citizens in the several states and the people of each state
shall in every other enjoy all the privileges of trade and
commerce etc there is a confusion of language here which is
remarkable why the terms free inhabitants are used in one part
of the article free citizens in another and people in another
or what was meant by superadding to all privileges and
immunities of free citizens all the privileges of trade and
commerce 
cannot easily be determined it seems to be a construction
scarcely avoidable however that those who come under the
denomination of free inhabitants of a state although not
citizens of such state are entitled in every other state to
all the privileges of free citizens of the latter that is to
greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own
state so that it may be in the power of a particular state or
rather every state is laid under a necessity not only to confer
the rights of citizenship in other states upon any whom it may
admit to such rights within itself but upon any whom it may
allow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction but were an
exposition of the term inhabitants to be admitted which
would confine the stipulated privileges to citizens alone the
difficulty is diminished only not removed the very improper
power would still be retained by each state of naturalizing
aliens in every other state in one state residence for a short
term confirms all the rights of citizenship in another
qualifications of greater importance are required an alien
therefore legally incapacitated for certain rights in the
latter may by previous residence only in the former elude his
incapacity and thus the law of one state be preposterously
rendered paramount to the law of another within the jurisdiction
of the other we owe it to mere casualty that very serious
embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped by the
laws of several states certain descriptions of aliens who had
rendered themselves obnoxious were laid under interdicts
inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the
privilege of residence what would have been the consequence if
such persons by residence or otherwise had acquired the
character of citizens under the laws of another state and then
asserted their rights as such both to residence and citizenship
within the state proscribing them whatever the legal
consequences might have been other consequences would probably
have resulted of too serious a nature not to be provided
against the new constitution has accordingly with great
propriety made provision against them and all others proceeding
from the defect of the confederation on this head by authorizing
the general government to establish a uniform rule of
naturalization throughout the united states the power of
establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately
connected with the regulation of commerce and will prevent so
many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be
removed into different states that the expediency of it seems
not likely to be drawn into question the power of prescribing
by general laws the manner in which the public acts records and
judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved and the
effect they shall have in other states is an evident and
valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in
the articles of confederation the meaning of the latter is
extremely indeterminate and can be of little importance under
any interpretation which it will bear the power here established
may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice and be
particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous states
where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly
translated in any stage of the process within a foreign
jurisdiction the power of establishing post roads must in
every view be a harmless power and may perhaps by judicious
management become productive of great public conveniency

states can be deemed unworthy of the public care publius

the fourth class comprises the following miscellaneous powers
a power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by
securing for a limited time to authors and inventors the
exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries
the utility of this power will scarcely be questioned the
copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged in great
britain to be a right of common law the right to useful
inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors
the public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of
individuals the states cannot separately make effectual
provisions for either of the cases and most of them have
anticipated the decision of this point by laws passed at the
instance of congress  to exercise exclusive legislation in
all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding ten miles
square as may by cession of particular states and the
acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the
united states and to exercise like authority over all places
purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the states in
which the same shall be for the erection of forts magazines
arsenals dockyards and other needful buildings the
indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of
government carries its own evidence with it it is a power
exercised by every legislature of the union i might say of the
world by virtue of its general supremacy without it not only
the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings
interrupted with impunity but a dependence of the members of the
general government on the state comprehending the seat of the
government for protection in the exercise of their duty might
bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence
equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the
other members of the confederacy this consideration has the more
weight as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the
stationary residence of the government would be both too great a
public pledge to be left in the hands of a single state and
would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government as
still further to abridge its necessary independence the extent
of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy
every jealousy of an opposite nature and as it is to be
appropriated to this use with the consent of the state ceding it
as the state will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights
and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it as the inhabitants
will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing
parties to the cession as they will have had their voice in the
election of the government which is to exercise authority over
them as a municipal legislature for local purposes derived from
their own suffrages will of course be allowed them and as the
authority of the legislature of the state and of the inhabitants
of the ceded part of it to concur in the cession will be
derived from the whole people of the state in their adoption of
the constitution every imaginable objection seems to be
obviated the necessity of a like authority over forts
magazines etc  established by the general government is not
less evident the public money expended on such places and the
public property deposited in them requires that they should be
exempt from the authority of the particular state nor would it
be proper for the places on which the security of the entire
union may depend to be in any degree dependent on a particular
member of it all objections and scruples are here also obviated
by requiring the concurrence of the states concerned in every
such establishment  to declare the punishment of treason
but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or
forfeiture except during the life of the person attained as
treason may be committed against the united states the authority
of the united states ought to be enabled to punish it but as
newfangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines
by which violent factions the natural offspring of free
government have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on
each other the convention have with great judgment opposed a
barrier to this peculiar danger by inserting a constitutional
definition of the crime fixing the proof necessary for
conviction of it and restraining the congress even in punishing
it from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of
its author  to admit new states into the union but no new
state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any
other state nor any state be formed by the junction of two or
more states or parts of states without the consent of the
legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the congress
in the articles of confederation no provision is found on this
important subject canada was to be admitted of right on her
joining in the measures of the united states and the other
colonies by which were evidently meant the other british
colonies at the discretion of nine states the eventual
establishment of new states seems to have been overlooked by the
compilers of that instrument we have seen the inconvenience of
this omission and the assumption of power into which congress
have been led by it with great propriety therefore has the new
system supplied the defect the general precaution that no new
states shall be formed without the concurrence of the federal
authority and that of the states concerned is consonant to the
principles which ought to govern such transactions the
particular precaution against the erection of new states by the
partition of a state without its consent quiets the jealousy of
the larger states as that of the smaller is quieted by a like
precaution against a junction of states without their consent
 to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory or other property belonging to the
united states with a proviso that nothing in the constitution
shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the united
states or of any particular state this is a power of very
great importance and required by considerations similar to those
which show the propriety of the former the proviso annexed is
proper in itself and was probably rendered absolutely necessary
by jealousies and questions concerning the western territory
sufficiently known to the public  to guarantee to every
state in the union a republican form of government to protect
each of them against invasion and on application of the
legislature or of the executive when the legislature cannot be
convened against domestic violence in a confederacy founded
on republican principles and composed of republican members the
superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to
defend the system against aristocratic or monarchial
innovations the more intimate the nature of such a union may be
the greater interest have the members in the political
institutions of each other and the greater right to insist that
the forms of government under which the compact was entered into
should be substantially maintained but a right implies a remedy
and where else could the remedy be deposited than where it is
deposited by the constitution governments of dissimilar
principles and forms have been found less adapted to a federal
coalition of any sort than those of a kindred nature as the
confederate republic of germany says montesquieu consists
of free cities and petty states subject to different princes
experience shows us that it is more imperfect than that of
holland and switzerland  greece was undone he adds as
soon as the king of macedon obtained a seat among the
amphictyons  in the latter case no doubt the
disproportionate force as well as the monarchical form of the
new confederate had its share of influence on the events it may
possibly be asked what need there could be of such a
precaution and whether it may not become a pretext for
alterations in the state governments without the concurrence of
the states themselves these questions admit of ready answers if
the interposition of the general government should not be
needed the provision for such an event will be a harmless
superfluity only in the constitution but who can say what
experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular states
by the ambition of enterprising leaders or by the intrigues and
influence of foreign powers to the second question it may be
answered that if the general government should interpose by
virtue of this constitutional authority it will be of course
bound to pursue the authority but the authority extends no
further than to a guaranty of a republican form of government
which supposes a preexisting government of the form which is to
be guaranteed as long therefore as the existing republican
forms are continued by the states they are guaranteed by the
federal constitution whenever the states may choose to
substitute other republican forms they have a right to do so
and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter the only
restriction imposed on them is that they shall not exchange
republican for antirepublican constitutions a restriction
which it is presumed will hardly be considered as a grievance
a protection against invasion is due from every society to the
parts composing it the latitude of the expression here used
seems to secure each state not only against foreign hostility
but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more
powerful neighbors the history both of ancient and modern
confederacies proves that the weaker members of the union ought
not to be insensible to the policy of this article protection
against domestic violence is added with equal propriety it has
been remarked that even among the swiss cantons which properly
speaking are not under one government provision is made for
this object and the history of that league informs us that
mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded and as well by
the most democratic as the other cantons a recent and
wellknown event among ourselves has warned us to be prepared for
emergencies of a like nature at first view it might seem not
to square with the republican theory to suppose either that a
majority have not the right or that a minority will have the
force to subvert a government and consequently that the
federal interposition can never be required but when it would be
improper but theoretic reasoning in this as in most other
cases must be qualified by the lessons of practice why may not
illicit combinations for purposes of violence be formed as
well by a majority of a state especially a small state as by a
majority of a county or a district of the same state and if
the authority of the state ought in the latter case to protect
the local magistracy ought not the federal authority in the
former to support the state authority besides there are
certain parts of the state constitutions which are so interwoven
with the federal constitution that a violent blow cannot be
given to the one without communicating the wound to the other
insurrections in a state will rarely induce a federal
interposition unless the number concerned in them bear some
proportion to the friends of government it will be much better
that the violence in such cases should be repressed by the
superintending power than that the majority should be left to
maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest the
existence of a right to interpose will generally prevent the
necessity of exerting it is it true that force and right are
necessarily on the same side in republican governments may not
the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary
resources of military talents and experience or of secret
succors from foreign powers as will render it superior also in
an appeal to the sword may not a more compact and advantageous
position turn the scale on the same side against a superior
number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and
collected exertion of its strength nothing can be more
chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force
victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census
of the inhabitants or which determine the event of an election 
may it not happen in fine that the minority of citizens may
become a majority of persons by the accession of alien
residents of a casual concourse of adventurers or of those whom
the constitution of the state has not admitted to the rights of
suffrage i take no notice of an unhappy species of population
abounding in some of the states who during the calm of regular
government are sunk below the level of men but who in the
tempestuous scenes of civil violence may emerge into the human
character and give a superiority of strength to any party with
which they may associate themselves in cases where it may be
doubtful on which side justice lies what better umpires could
be desired by two violent factions flying to arms and tearing a
state to pieces than the representatives of confederate states
not heated by the local flame to the impartiality of judges
they would unite the affection of friends happy would it be if
such a remedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free
governments if a project equally effectual could be established
for the universal peace of mankind should it be asked what is
to be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the states
and comprising a superiority of the entire force though not a
constitutional right the answer must be that such a case as
it would be without the compass of human remedies so it is
fortunately not within the compass of human probability and
that it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal
constitution that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for which
no possible constitution can provide a cure among the
advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by montesquieu
an important one is that should a popular insurrection happen
in one of the states the others are able to quell it should
abuses creep into one part they are reformed by those that
remain sound  to consider all debts contracted and
engagements entered into before the adoption of this
constitution as being no less valid against the united states
under this constitution than under the confederation this
can only be considered as a declaratory proposition and may have
been inserted among other reasons for the satisfaction of the
foreign creditors of the united states who cannot be strangers
to the pretended doctrine that a change in the political form of
civil society has the magical effect of dissolving its moral
obligations among the lesser criticisms which have been
exercised on the constitution it has been remarked that the
validity of engagements ought to have been asserted in favor of
the united states as well as against them and in the spirit
which usually characterizes little critics the omission has been
transformed and magnified into a plot against the national
rights the authors of this discovery may be told what few
others need to be informed of that as engagements are in their
nature reciprocal an assertion of their validity on one side
necessarily involves a validity on the other side and that as
the article is merely declaratory the establishment of the
principle in one case is sufficient for every case they may be
further told that every constitution must limit its precautions
to dangers that are not altogether imaginary and that no real
danger can exist that the government would dare with or even
without this constitutional declaration before it to remit the
debts justly due to the public on the pretext here condemned 
to provide for amendments to be ratified by three fourths of
the states under two exceptions only that useful alterations
will be suggested by experience could not but be foreseen it
was requisite therefore that a mode for introducing them should
be provided the mode preferred by the convention seems to be
stamped with every mark of propriety it guards equally against
that extreme facility which would render the constitution too
mutable and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its
discovered faults it moreover equally enables the general and
the state governments to originate the amendment of errors as
they may be pointed out by the experience on one side or on the
other the exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the
senate was probably meant as a palladium to the residuary
sovereignty of the states implied and secured by that principle
of representation in one branch of the legislature and was
probably insisted on by the states particularly attached to that
equality the other exception must have been admitted on the same
considerations which produced the privilege defended by it 
the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be
sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the
states ratifying the same this article speaks for itself
the express authority of the people alone could give due validity
to the constitution to have required the unanimous ratification
of the thirteen states would have subjected the essential
interests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a single
member it would have marked a want of foresight in the
convention which our own experience would have rendered
inexcusable two questions of a very delicate nature present
themselves on this occasion  on what principle the
confederation which stands in the solemn form of a compact among
the states can be superseded without the unanimous consent of
the parties to it  what relation is to subsist between the
nine or more states ratifying the constitution and the remaining
few who do not become parties to it the first question is
answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the
case to the great principle of selfpreservation to the
transcendent law of nature and of natures god which declares
that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which
all political institutions aim and to which all such
institutions must be sacrificed perhaps also an answer may be
found without searching beyond the principles of the compact
itself it has been heretofore noted among the defects of the
confederation that in many of the states it had received no
higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification the
principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation
on the other states should be reduced to the same standard a
compact between independent sovereigns founded on ordinary acts
of legislative authority can pretend to no higher validity than
a league or treaty between the parties it is an established
doctrine on the subject of treaties that all the articles are
mutually conditions of each other that a breach of any one
article is a breach of the whole treaty and that a breach
committed by either of the parties absolves the others and
authorizes them if they please to pronounce the compact
violated and void should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to
these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with
the consent of particular states to a dissolution of the federal
pact will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task
to answer the multiplied and important infractions with which
they may be confronted the time has been when it was incumbent
on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits the
scene is now changed and with it the part which the same motives
dictate the second question is not less delicate and the
flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an
overcurious discussion of it it is one of those cases which must
be left to provide for itself in general it may be observed
that although no political relation can subsist between the
assenting and dissenting states yet the moral relations will
remain uncancelled the claims of justice both on one side and
on the other will be in force and must be fulfilled the
rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually
respected whilst considerations of a common interest and
above all the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are
past and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles
to reunion will it is hoped not urge in vain moderation on one
side and prudence on the other publius 
federalist no 
restrictions on the authority of the several states
from the new york packet friday january   
madison
to the people of the state of new york
a fifth class of provisions in favor of the federal authority
consists of the following restrictions on the authority of the
several states no state shall enter into any treaty
alliance or confederation grant letters of marque and reprisal
coin money emit bills of credit make any thing but gold and
silver a legal tender in payment of debts pass any bill of
attainder expostfacto law or law impairing the obligation of
contracts or grant any title of nobility the prohibition
against treaties alliances and confederations makes a part of
the existing articles of union and for reasons which need no
explanation is copied into the new constitution the prohibition
of letters of marque is another part of the old system but is
somewhat extended in the new according to the former letters of
marque could be granted by the states after a declaration of war
according to the latter these licenses must be obtained as well
during war as previous to its declaration from the government of
the united states this alteration is fully justified by the
advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign
powers and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all
those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible
the right of coining money which is here taken from the states
was left in their hands by the confederation as a concurrent
right with that of congress under an exception in favor of the
exclusive right of congress to regulate the alloy and value in
this instance also the new provision is an improvement on the
old whilst the alloy and value depended on the general
authority a right of coinage in the particular states could have
no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify
the forms and weights of the circulating pieces the latter
inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was
originally submitted to the federal head and as far as the
former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and
silver to the central mint for recoinage the end can be as well
attained by local mints established under the general authority
the extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give
pleasure to every citizen in proportion to his love of justice
and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity the
loss which america has sustained since the peace from the
pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence
between man and man on the necessary confidence in the public
councils on the industry and morals of the people and on the
character of republican government constitutes an enormous debt
against the states chargeable with this unadvised measure which
must long remain unsatisfied or rather an accumulation of guilt
which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice
on the altar of justice of the power which has been the
instrument of it in addition to these persuasive
considerations it may be observed that the same reasons which
show the necessity of denying to the states the power of
regulating coin prove with equal force that they ought not to be
at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin had
every state a right to regulate the value of its coin there
might be as many different currencies as states and thus the
intercourse among them would be impeded retrospective
alterations in its value might be made and thus the citizens of
other states be injured and animosities be kindled among the
states themselves the subjects of foreign powers might suffer
from the same cause and hence the union be discredited and
embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member no one of these
mischiefs is less incident to a power in the states to emit paper
money than to coin gold or silver the power to make any thing
but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts is withdrawn
from the states on the same principle with that of issuing a
paper currency bills of attainder expostfacto laws and laws
impairing the obligation of contracts are contrary to the first
principles of the social compact and to every principle of sound
legislation the two former are expressly prohibited by the
declarations prefixed to some of the state constitutions and all
of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these
fundamental charters our own experience has taught us
nevertheless that additional fences against these dangers ought
not to be omitted very properly therefore have the convention
added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security
and private rights and i am much deceived if they have not in
so doing as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the
undoubted interests of their constituents the sober people of
america are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed
the public councils they have seen with regret and indignation
that sudden changes and legislative interferences in cases
affecting personal rights become jobs in the hands of
enterprising and influential speculators and snares to the
moreindustrious and lessinformed part of the community they
have seen too that one legislative interference is but the
first link of a long chain of repetitions every subsequent
interference being naturally produced by the effects of the
preceding they very rightly infer therefore that some thorough
reform is wanting which will banish speculations on public
measures inspire a general prudence and industry and give a
regular course to the business of society the prohibition with
respect to titles of nobility is copied from the articles of
confederation and needs no comment  no state shall without
the consent of the congress lay any imposts or duties on imports
or exports except what may be absolutely necessary for executing
its inspection laws and the net produce of all duties and
imposts laid by any state on imports or exports shall be for the
use of the treasury of the united states and all such laws shall
be subject to the revision and control of the congress no state
shall without the consent of congress lay any duty on tonnage
keep troops or ships of war in time of peace enter into any
agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power
or engage in war unless actually invaded or in such imminent
danger as will not admit of delay the restraint on the power
of the states over imports and exports is enforced by all the
arguments which prove the necessity of submitting the regulation
