 respects the most interesting in the world it has been frequently
 remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this
 country by their conduct and example to decide the important
 question whether societies of men are really capable or not of
 favorable to the discovery of truth
among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new
 constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the
 obvious interest of a certain class of men in every state to resist
 powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the
 judgment that we upon many occasions see wise and good men on the
 wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first
 magnitude to society this circumstance if duly attended to would
 angry and malignant passions will be let loose to judge from the
 conduct of the opposite parties we shall be led to conclude that
 they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions
 and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of
 teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to
 the introduction of despotism than the latter and that of those men
 who have overturned the liberties of republics the greatest number
 have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people
 professions on this head my motives must remain in the depository
 of my own breast my arguments will be open to all and may be
 judged of by all they shall at least be offered in a spirit which
 will not disgrace the cause of truth
 on the hearts of the great body of the people in every state and
 one which it may be imagined has no adversaries but the fact is
 that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those
 who oppose the new constitution that the thirteen states are of too

when the people of america reflect that they are now called upon
 our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that
 object but politicians now appear who insist that this opinion is
 erroneous and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in
 union we ought to seek it in a division of the states into distinct
 distances present them with highways for the easy communication of
 friendly aids and the mutual transportation and exchange of their
 various commodities
with equal pleasure i have as often taken notice that providence
 our common enemies as a nation we have formed alliances and made
 treaties and entered into various compacts and conventions with
 foreign states
a strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the
this convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of
 the people and many of whom had become highly distinguished by
 their patriotism virtue and wisdom in times which tried the minds
 and hearts of men undertook the arduous task in the mild season
 yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem
 with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures not
 only many of the officers of government who obeyed the dictates of
 personal interest but others from a mistaken estimate of
 advisable
these and similar considerations then induced the people to rely
 greatly on the judgment and integrity of the congress and they
 took their advice notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors
 depreciate the importance of the union or why is it suggested that
 three or four confederacies would be better than one i am
 persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right
 on this subject and that their universal and uniform attachment to
it is not a new observation that the people of any country if
 like the americans intelligent and wellinformed seldom adopt and
 steadily persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting
 their interests that consideration naturally tends to create great
 first in order it is proper it should be the first discussed let
 us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in
 their opinion that a cordial union under an efficient national
 government affords them the best security that can be devised
it is of high importance to the peace of america that she
 observe the laws of nations towards all these powers and to me it
 appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done
 by one national government than it could be either by thirteen
 treaties as well as the laws of nations will always be expounded
 in one sense and executed in the same mannerwhereas adjudications
 on the same points and questions in thirteen states or in three or
 four confederacies will not always accord or be consistent and
 party may not always be able if willing to prevent the injustice
 meditated or to punish the aggressors but the national
 government not being affected by those local circumstances will
 neither be induced to commit the wrong themselves nor want power or
 given occasion to the slaughter of many innocent inhabitants
the neighborhood of spanish and british territories bordering
 on some states and not on others naturally confines the causes of
 quarrel more immediately to the borderers the bordering states if
besides it is well known that acknowledgments explanations
 and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong
 united nation which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered
 by a state or confederacy of little consideration or power
 reasons show that such causes would not only be more rarely given
 but would also be more easily accommodated by a national government
 than either by the state governments or the proposed little
 confederacies
 monarchies but which well deserve our attention there are others
 which affect nations as often as kings and some of them will on
 examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and
 circumstances
 added to the circumstance of vicinity and the enterprise and
 address of our merchants and navigators will give us a greater
 share in the advantages which those territories afford than
 consists with the wishes or policy of their respective sovereigns
 and a good national government as necessary to put and keep them in
 such a situation as instead of inviting war will tend to repress
 and discourage it that situation consists in the best possible
 state of defense and necessarily depends on the government the
 the militia under one plan of discipline and by putting their
 officers in a proper line of subordination to the chief magistrate
 will as it were consolidate them into one corps and thereby
 render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into
 those four of the constituent parts of the british empire be be
 under four independent governments and it is easy to perceive how
 soon they would each dwindle into comparative insignificance
apply these facts to our own case leave america divided into
 the terms of peace and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide
 between them and compel acquiescence various difficulties and
 inconveniences would be inseparable from such a situation whereas
 one government watching over the general and common interests and
 and perhaps played off against each other by the three what a poor
 pitiful figure will america make in their eyes how liable would
 she become not only to their contempt but to their outrage and how
 soon would dearbought experience proclaim that when a people or
 being joined in affection and free from all apprehensions of
 different interest will be enabled to resist all its enemies
 we most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this
 great and weighty affair that the union may be brought to a happy
 nations was really the same yet by the arts and policy and
 practices of those nations their mutual jealousies were perpetually
 kept inflamed and for a long series of years they were far more
 inconvenient and troublesome than they were useful and assisting to
 increase power in one part and to impede its progress in another we
 must advert to the effects of that superior policy and good
 management which would probably distinguish the government of one
 above the rest and by which their relative equality in strength and
 and uncandid imputations whether expressed or implied
the north is generally the region of strength and many local
 circumstances render it probable that the most northern of the
 proposed confederacies would at a period not very distant be
 might be formed between these confederacies and would produce that
 combination and union of wills of arms and of resources which would
 be necessary to put and keep them in a formidable state of defense
 against foreign enemies
 neighboring nations acting under the impulse of opposite interests
 and unfriendly passions would frequently be found taking different
 sides considering our distance from europe it would be more
 natural for these confederacies to apprehend danger from one another

 most fertile sources of hostility among nations perhaps the
 greatest proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have
 sprung from this origin this cause would exist among us in full
 force we have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the
 united states for the benefit of the whole this has been so far
 accomplished as under a continuation of the union to afford a
 decided prospect of an amicable termination of the dispute a
 dismemberment of the confederacy however would revive this
in the wide field of western territory therefore we perceive
 an ample theatre for hostile pretensions without any umpire or
 common judge to interpose between the contending parties to reason
 from the past to the future we shall have good ground to apprehend
 transactions which attended the progress of the controversy between
 this state and the district of vermont can vouch the opposition we

the competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of
 contention the states less favorably circumstanced would be

 neither the pride nor the safety of the more important states or
 confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying
 and adventitious superiority they would quickly resort to means
 similar to those by which it had been effected to reinstate
 commerce are incompatible with the condition of a nation of
 soldiers which was the true condition of the people of those
 republics the means of revenue which have been so greatly
 multiplied by the increase of gold and silver and of the arts of
 army renders the natural strength of the community an overmatch for
 it and the citizens not habituated to look up to the military
 power for protection or to submit to its oppressions neither love
 nor fear the soldiery they view them with a spirit of jealous
 superiors the transition from this disposition to that of
 considering them masters is neither remote nor difficult but it
 is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions

 the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government
 but they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that

 policy such a desperate expedient might by the multiplication of
 petty offices answer the views of men who possess not
 qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles

 have everywhere perished as they continue to be the favorite and
 fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their
 most specious declamations the valuable improvements made by the
 american constitutions on the popular models both ancient and
 and particularly for that prevailing and increasing distrust of
 public engagements and alarm for private rights which are echoed
 from one end of the continent to the other these must be chiefly
 if not wholly effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which

no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause because his

 various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require
 the most exact impartiality yet there is perhaps no legislative
 act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a
 predominant party to trample on the rules of justice every
 when a majority is included in a faction the form of popular
 government on the other hand enables it to sacrifice to its ruling
 passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other
 citizens to secure the public good and private rights against the
from this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure
 democracy by which i mean a society consisting of a small number of
 citizens who assemble and administer the government in person can
 admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction a common passion or
 the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from
 the union
the two great points of difference between a democracy and a
 republic are first the delegation of the government in the
 guardians of the public weal and it is clearly decided in favor of
 the latter by two obvious considerations
in the first place it is to be remarked that however small the
 republic may be the representatives must be raised to a certain
 is a mean on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to
 lie by enlarging too much the number of electors you render the
 representatives too little acquainted with all their local
 circumstances and lesser interests as by reducing it too much you
 parties and interests you make it less probable that a majority of
 the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other
 citizens or if such a common motive exists it will be more
 difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength and to
 opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an
 unjust and interested majority here again the extent of the
 union gives it the most palpable advantage

 of fostering divisions among us and of depriving us as far as
 such a nation between a direct communication in its own ships and

 enhancing the price of british commodities in our markets and by
 transferring to other hands the management of this interesting
 branch of the british commerce
 in our power at a period not very distant to create a navy which
 if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers would
 at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either
 of two contending parties this would be more peculiarly the case

 commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations
 at war with each other who having nothing to fear from us would
 with little scruple or remorse supply their wants by depredations
 have a common interest in being our carriers and still more in
 preventing our becoming theirs they would in all probability
 combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in
 effect destroy it and confine us to a passive commerce we should

 to that decided mastery of which experience has shown us to be
 possessed in this valuable branch of traffic and by which we are
 able to undersell those nations in their own markets what more
 that different portions of confederated america possess each some
 peculiar advantage for this essential establishment the more

 of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop it can call to
 its aid the staple of another the variety not less than the
 value of products for exportation contributes to the activity of
 causes which in the course of these papers have been amply detailed 
 a unity of commercial as well as political interests can only
 result from a unity of government
there are other points of view in which this subject might be
 atmosphere facts have too long supported these arrogant
 pretensions of the europeans it belongs to us to vindicate the
 honor of the human race and to teach that assuming brother
 moderation union will enable us to do it disunion will will add
the prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by
 all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most
 productive source of national wealth and has accordingly become a
 primary object of their political cares by multipying the means of
 increasing the quantity of money in a statecould that in fine
 which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry in every
 shape fail to augment that article which is the prolific parent of
 far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are exerted
 obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the
 preservation of his essential interests and is unable upon the
 strength of his own resources to sustain a long or continued war
but it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that union
 more tolerable and from the vigor of the government much more
 practicable than in america far the greatest part of the national
 revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind from imposts
 and from excises duties on imported articles form a large branch
 to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more
 simple and efficacious so far it must serve to answer the purposes
 of making the same rate of duties more productive and of putting it
 into the power of the government to increase the rate without
 constantly employed to secure their fiscal regulations against the
 inroads of the dealers in contraband trade mr neckar computes the
 number of these patrols at upwards of twenty thousand this shows
 the immense difficulty in preventing that species of traffic where
 rights of the revenue a few armed vessels judiciously stationed
 at the entrances of our ports might at a small expense be made
 useful sentinels of the laws and the government having the same
 interest to provide against violations everywhere the cooperation
 able at much less expense to extend the duties on imports beyond
 comparison further than would be practicable to the states
 separately or to any partial confederacies hitherto i believe
 it may safely be asserted that these duties have not upon an
 cannot long exist without revenues destitute of this essential
 support it must resign its independence and sink into the degraded
 condition of a province this is an extremity to which no
 government will of choice accede revenue therefore must be had
 possessors of land and as on the other hand the wants of the
 government can never obtain an adequate supply unless all the
 sources of revenue are open to its demands the finances of the
 community under such embarrassments cannot be put into a situation
 under one government there will be but one national civil list to
 support if they are divided into several confederacies there will
 be as many different national civil lists to be provided forand
 each of them as to the principal departments coextensive with that
 rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary
 to the government of any given number of individuals but when we
 consider that the island of britain nearly commensurate with each

 irreconcilable at an augmentation of federal authority without a
 diminution of state authority at sovereignty in the union and
 regulations extending to the individual citizens of america the
 consequence of this is that though in theory their resolutions
 concerning those objects are laws constitutionally binding on the
 members of the union yet in practice they are mere recommendations

this exceptionable principle may as truly as emphatically be

 and that whenever they happen the only constitutional remedy is
 danger to the common liberty could easily be contrived plausible
 excuses for the deficiencies of the party could without difficulty
 be invented to alarm the apprehensions inflame the passions and
 conciliate the goodwill even of those states which were not
this may be considered as the violent death of the confederacy
 its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of
 experiencing if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a
 more substantial form it is not probable considering the genius
 of partiality and of oppression in the majority that happened to
 prevail in the national council
it seems to require no pains to prove that the states ought not
 to prefer a national constitution which could only be kept in motion
 than the monstertaming spirit which is attributed to the fabulous
 heroes and demigods of antiquity
even in those confederacies which have been composed of members
 smaller than many of our counties the principle of legislation for
 government of the union like that of each state must be able to
 address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals
 and to attract to its support those passions which have the
 strongest influence upon the human heart it must in short

but if the execution of the laws of the national government
 should not require the intervention of the state legislatures if

 preponderancy in the contest attempts of this kind would not often
 be made with levity or rashness because they could seldom be made
 without danger to the authors unless in cases of a tyrannical
 government or from the contagion of some violent popular paroxysm
 they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation when
 they happen they commonly amount to revolutions and dismemberments

 riches belonging to the temple of delphos where they had the right
 of jurisdiction in controversies between the inhabitants and those
 who came to consult the oracle as a further provision for the
 awe and subordination tyrannized successively over all the rest
 athens as we learn from demosthenes was the arbiter of greece
 seventythree years the lacedaemonians next governed it
 twentynine years at a subsequent period after the battle of
 members and the dependent and degraded condition of the rest the
 smaller members though entitled by the theory of their system to
 revolve in equal pride and majesty around the common center had
 become in fact satellites of the orbs of primary magnitude
 abetted by athens and sparta refused to submit to the decree the
 thebans with others of the cities undertook to maintain the
 authority of the amphictyons and to avenge the violated god the
 latter being the weaker party invited the assistance of philip of
 that though not exempt from a similar catastrophe it by no means
 equally deserved it
the cities composing this league retained their municipal
 jurisdiction appointed their own officers and enjoyed a perfect
 of those of the achaeans the amphictyonic confederacy of which
 she had been a member left her in the full exercise of her
 government and her legislation this circumstance alone proves a
 very material difference in the genius of the two systems
 not in a certain degree agitate the particular cities much less
 that a due subordination and harmony reigned in the general system
 the contrary is sufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate
 of the republic
 on the enterprise the dread of the macedonian power induced the
 league to court the alliance of the kings of egypt and syria who
 as successors of alexander were rivals of the king of macedon
 this policy was defeated by cleomenes king of sparta who was led
 and athenians erected the standard of opposition finding
 themselves though thus supported unequal to the undertaking they
 once more had recourse to the dangerous expedient of introducing the
 succor of foreign arms the romans to whom the invitation was
 lesson and because as a supplement to the outlines of the achaean
 constitution it emphatically illustrates the tendency of federal
 bodies rather to anarchy among the members than to tyranny in the
 head

 warlike monarch carried his victorious arms in every direction

out of this feudal system which has itself many of the
 important features of a confederacy has grown the federal system
 which constitutes the germanic empire its powers are vested in a
 the public peace and the ban is denounced against such as shall
 violate any of these restrictions the members of the diet as
 such are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and diet
 and in their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial
 rests that the empire is a community of sovereigns that the diet
 is a representation of sovereigns and that the laws are addressed to
 sovereigns renders the empire a nerveless body incapable of
 regulating its own members insecure against external dangers and

 one half of the empire was on one side and sweden with the other
 half on the opposite side peace was at length negotiated and

 interior organization and of charging them with the military
 execution of the laws against delinquent and contumacious members
 this experiment has only served to demonstrate more fully the
 that his ancestors had suffered the place to be dismembered from his
 territory he took possession of it in his own name disarmed
 and punished the inhabitants and reannexed the city to his domains
it may be asked perhaps what has so long kept this disjointed
 betrayed their policy of perpetuating its anarchy and weakness
if more direct examples were wanting poland as a government
 over local sovereigns might not improperly be taken notice of nor
 could any proof more striking be given of the calamities flowing
 stipulated and often required and afforded and by the necessity of
 some regular and permanent provision for accomodating disputes among
 the cantons the provision is that the parties at variance shall
 each choose four judges out of the neutral cantons who in case of
 diet little other business than to take care of the common bailages
that separation had another consequence which merits attention
 it produced opposite alliances with foreign powers of berne at
 the head of the protestant association with the united provinces
the union is composed of seven coequal and sovereign states and
 each state or province is a composition of equal and independent
 cities in all important cases not only the provinces but the
 cities must be unanimous
 a council of state a chamber of accounts with five colleges of
 admiralty aid and fortify the federal administration
the executive magistrate of the union is the stadtholder who is
 now an hereditary prince his principal weight and influence in the
 disposes of all appointments from colonels to ensigns and of the
 governments and posts of fortified towns
in his marine capacity he is admiralgeneral and superintends
 and directs every thing relative to naval forces and other naval
 harmony but the jealousy in each province renders the practice very
 different from the theory
the same instrument says another obliges each province to levy
 certain contributions but this article never could and probably

 pause my fellowcitizens for one moment over this melancholy and
 monitory lesson of history and with the tear that drops for the
 calamities brought on mankind by their adverse opinions and selfish
 passions let our gratitude mingle an ejaculation to heaven for the

 conclusive and sacred the important truth which it unequivocally
 pronounces in the present case is that a sovereignty over
 sovereigns a government over governments a legislation for
 remedy it is absolutely necessary that we should be well acquainted
 with the extent and malignity of the disease
the next most palpable defect of the subsisting confederation
 is the total want of a sanction to its laws the united states as
 severe criticism if we are unwilling to impair the force of this
 applauded provision we shall be obliged to conclude that the
 united states afford the extraordinary spectacle of a government
 destitute even of the shadow of constitutional power to enforce the
 the people while the national government could legally do nothing
 more than behold its encroachments with indignation and regret a
 successful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and
 law while no succor could constitutionally be afforded by the union
 only operate against changes to be effected by violence towards
 the preventions of calamities of this kind too many checks cannot
 be provided the peace of society and the stability of government
 depend absolutely on the efficacy of the precautions adopted on this
 ascertained neither the value of lands nor the numbers of the
 people which have been successively proposed as the rule of state
 contributions has any pretension to being a just representative
 if we compare the wealth of the united netherlands with that of
 than it would appear to be if we should take either the total value
 of the lands or the total number of the people as a criterion
the wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of causes
 situation soil climate the nature of the productions the
 which was calculated to impoverish and oppress the citizens of some
 states while those of others would scarcely be conscious of the
 small proportion of the weight they were required to sustain this
 however is an evil inseparable from the principle of quotas and
 their degree so uniform in their operation nor so odious in their
 appearance as those which would necessarily spring from quotas
 upon any scale that can possibly be devised
it is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption
 populousness of a country have been considered as nearly connected
 with each other and as a rule for the purpose intended numbers
 in the view of simplicity and certainty are entitled to a
 preference in every country it is a herculean task to obtain a
 federal system there are others of not less importance which
 concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the administration of
 the affairs of the union
the want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties
 convenience might suggest it is not therefore to be wondered at
 that mr jenkinson in ushering into the house of commons a bill for
 regulating the temporary intercourse between the two countries
 should preface its introduction by a declaration that similar
 injurious impediments to the intcrcourse between the different parts
 of the confederacy the commerce of the german empire  is in
 continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the
 several princes and states exact upon the merchandises passing
 those who were disposed to serve to procrastinate their enlistment
 and disinclined them from engaging for any considerable periods
 hence slow and scanty levies of men in the most critical
 emergencies of our affairs short enlistments at an unparalleled
 the supplies of men we shall not however see much reason to
 reget the want of this hope when we consider how little prospect
 there is that the most delinquent states will ever be able to make
 compensation for their pecuniary failures the system of quotas and
 america  and two thirds of the people of america could not
 long be persuaded upon the credit of artificial distinctions and
 syllogistic subtleties to submit their interests to the management
 and disposal of one third the larger states would after a while
 matters of considerable moment determinable by a bare majority and
 there are others concerning which doubts have been entertained
 which if interpreted in favor of the sufficiency of a vote of seven
 states would extend its operation to interests of the first
 but its real operation is to embarrass the administration to
 destroy the energy of the government and to substitute the
 pleasure caprice or artifices of an insignificant turbulent or
 corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a
 border upon anarchy
it is not difficult to discover that a principle of this kind
 gives greater scope to foreign corruption as well as to domestic
 faction than that which permits the sense of the majority to
 his bribes and intrigues to tie up the hands of government from
 making peace where two thirds of all the votes were requisite to
 that object than where a simple majority would suffice in the
 first case he would have to corrupt a smaller number in the last
 every other kind
in republics persons elevated from the mass of the community
 by the suffrages of their fellowcitizens to stations of great
 preeminence and power may find compensations for betraying their
 uncontrolled
a circumstance which crowns the defects of the confederation
 remains yet to be mentioned the want of a judiciary power laws
 are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true
 resort a uniform rule of civil justice
this is the more necessary where the frame of the government is
 so compounded that the laws of the whole are in danger of being
 contravened by the laws of the parts in this case if the
 possible that the people of america will longer consent to trust
 their honor their happiness their safety on so precarious a
 foundation
in this review of the confederation i have confined myself to
 necessity of the union should be able to withstand the ambitious
 aims of those men who may indulge magnificent schemes of personal
 aggrandizement from its dissolution the probability would be that
 we should run into the project of conferring supplementary powers

 with such an excess if it be true as has been insinuated by some

 the strongest argument in favor of an energetic government for any
 other can certainly never preserve the union of so large an empire
 if we embrace the tenets of those who oppose the adoption of the
 proposed constitution as the standard of our political creed we
 form supported only by bold assertions without the appearance of
 argument without even the sanction of theoretical opinions in
 contradiction to the practice of other free nations and to the
 general sense of america as expressed in most of the existing
 legislature not in the executive that this legislature was to be
 a popular body consisting of the representatives of the people
 periodically elected and that instead of the provision he had
 supposed in favor of standing armies there was to be found in
 to find that two only of them  contained an interdiction of
 standing armies in time of peace that the other eleven had either
 observed a profound silence on the subject or had in express terms
 admitted the right of the legislature to authorize their existence
 unexpected discovery that these articles instead of containing the
 prohibition he looked for and though they had with jealous
 circumspection restricted the authority of the state legislatures
 in this particular had not imposed a single restraint on that of
 much the appearance of an intention to mislead the people by
 alarming their passions rather than to convince them by arguments
 addressed to their understandings
but however little this objection may be countenanced even by

 times of profound peace and if they could be prevailed upon or

 the remainder it may be added that some of those posts will be
 keys to the trade with the indian nations can any man think it
 would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any
 standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty they
 ought not to be kept up this is in truth rather a caution than
 a prohibition new hampshire massachusetts delaware and maryland
 have in each of their bils of rights a clause to this effect
it may perhaps be urged that the objects enumerated in the
 preceding number ought to be provided for by the state governments
 under the direction of the union but this would be in reality an
 inversion of the primary principle of our political association as
 willing for a considerable time to come to bear the burden of
 competent provisions the security of all would thus be subjected
 to the parsimony improvidence or inability of a part if the
 resources of such part becoming more abundant and extensive its
 temptation and too great a facility to them to make enterprises
 upon and finally to subvert the constitutional authority of the
 union on the other hand the liberty of the people would be less
 safe in this state of things than in that which left the national
 which the impropriety of restraints on the discretion of the
 national legislature will be equally manifest the design of the
 objection which has been mentioned is to preclude standing armies
 in time of peace though we have never been informed how far it is
 might afterwards keep them on foot as long as they supposed the
 peace or safety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy it
 is easy to perceive that a discretion so latitudinary as this would
 afford ample room for eluding the force of the provision
 constitution to prepare for defense before it was actually invaded
 as the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen
 into disuse the presence of an enemy within our territories must be
 waited for as the legal warrant to the government to begin its
 war against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully
 conducted by a force of the same kind considerations of economy
 not less than of stability and vigor confirm this position the
 american militia in the course of the late war have by their
 waiting for the sanction of congress as the articles of the
 confederation require was compelled to raise troops to quell a
 domestic insurrection and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a
 revival of the spirit of revolt the particular constitution of
 recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of investing lysander with the
 real power of admiral under the nominal title of viceadmiral
 this instance is selected from among a multitude that might be
 cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illustrated by
it was a thing hardly to be expected that in a popular
 revolution the minds of men should stop at that happy mean which
 marks the salutary boundary between power and privilege and
 combines the energy of government with the security of private
 than to embarrass the government and endanger the public safety by
 impolitic restrictions on the legislative authority the opponents
 of the proposed constitution combat in this respect the general
 decision of america and instead of being taught by experience the
 establishments in time of peace though in speculative minds it may
 arise from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of such
 institutions fortified by the events that have happened in other
 ages and countries yet as a national sentiment it must be traced
 parliament was against law
in that kingdom when the pulse of liberty was at its highest
 pitch no security against the danger of standing armies was thought
 requisite beyond a prohibition of their being raised or kept up by
 temperature of the body politic the attempts of two of the states
 to restrict the authority of the legislature in the article of
 military establishments are of the number of these instances the
 principles which had taught us to be jealous of the power of an
it is remarkable that even in the two states which seem to have
 meditated an interdiction of military establishments in time of
 peace the mode of expression made use of is rather cautionary than
 prohibitory it is not said that standing armies shall not be kept
 years the former by aiming at too much is calculated to effect
 nothing the latter by steering clear of an imprudent extreme and
 by being perfectly compatible with a proper provision for the
 exigencies of the nation will have a salutary and powerful
 community will be warned of the danger and will have an opportunity
 of taking measures to guard against it independent of parties in
 the national legislature itself as often as the period of
 discussion arrived the state legislatures who will always be not
 representatives would commence a traitor to his constituents and to
 his country can it be supposed that there would not be found one
 man discerning enough to detect so atrocious a conspiracy or bold
 or honest enough to apprise his constituents of their danger if
 possessed of a force large enough to awe the people into submission
 would find resources in that very force sufficient to enable him to
 dispense with supplies from the acts of the legislature but the
 question again recurs upon what pretense could he be put in
 situation it is not easy to conceive a possibility that dangers so
 formidable can assail the whole union as to demand a force
 considerable enough to place our liberties in the least jeopardy
 especially if we take into our view the aid to be derived from the
 general assertion unsupported by any precise or intelligible
 designation of the reasons upon which it is founded as far as i
 have been able to divine the latent meaning of the objectors it
 seems to originate in a presupposition that the people will be
 papers to induce a probability that the general government will be
 better administered than the particular governments the principal
 of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres of election
 will present a greater option or latitude of choice to the people
 federal government is likely to be administered in such a manner as
 to render it odious or contemptible to the people there can be no
 reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws of the union
 will meet with any greater obstruction from them or will stand in
 more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in
 the ordinary exercise of government the more the citizens are
 accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their
 political life the more it is familiarized to their sight and to

 of using force than that species of league contend for by most of

in order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the
 militia to execute the laws of the union it has been remarked that
 there is nowhere any provision in the proposed constitution for
 alienation of landed property or of abolishing the trial by jury in
 cases relating to it it being therefore evident that the
 supposition of a want of power to require the aid of the posse

 my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature from this state
 on the subject of a militia establishment i should hold to him in
 substance the following discourse

 properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not

 far as the resources of the community will permit may be regarded
 as an indispensable ingredient in every constitution from a
 deficiency in this particular one of two evils must ensue either

 has been done in such a manner as entirely to have frustrated the
 intention congress by the articles which compose that compact as
 has already been stated are authorized to ascertain and call for
what remedy can there be for this situation but in a change of
 the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and
 delusive system of quotas and requisitions what substitute can
 there be imagined for this ignis fatuus in finance but that of
 governments inconsistent with every idea of vigor or efficiency
 who can pretend that commercial imposts are or would be alone
 equal to the present and future exigencies of the union taking
 into the account the existing debt foreign and domestic upon any
 experience or delineated in the course of these papers must feel
 invincible repugnancy to trusting the national interests in any
 degree to its operation its inevitable tendency whenever it is
 brought into activity must be to enfeeble the union and sow the
 home or respectability abroad how can its administration be any
 thing else than a succession of expedients temporizing impotent
 disgraceful how will it be able to avoid a frequent sacrifice of
 its engagements to immediate necessity how can it undertake or
 credit might be dispensed with would be the extreme of infatuation
 in the modern system of war nations the most wealthy are obliged
 to have recourse to large loans a country so little opulent as
 ours must feel this necessity in a much stronger degree but who

 inferences from them and so obvious in themselves and so agreeable
 to the natural and unsophisticated dictates of commonsense that

 carried too far and may degenerate into obstinacy perverseness or
 disingenuity though it cannot be pretended that the principles of

 free from every other control but a regard to the public good and to

 national government might safely be permitted to rest on the
 evidence of these propositions unassisted by any additional
 arguments or illustrations but we find in fact that the

 the most absolute and unqualified sense and that an attempt on the
 part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of

 article or clause of its constitution
 of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional
 interferences in the policy of any branch of administration but
 would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of
 constitutional authority these three cases of exclusive
 that congress shall have power to establish an uniform rule of
 naturalization throughout the united states this must
 necessarily be exclusive because if each state had power to
 prescribe a distinct rule there could not be a uniform rule
 laying such duties implied the exclusion of the states or even
 their subordination in this particular there could be no need of
 such a restriction it would be dangerous because the introduction
 of it leads directly to the conclusion which has been mentioned and
 exports and that they might tax every other article unless
 controlled by the same body if this was the intention why not
 leave it in the first instance to what is alleged to be the
 natural operation of the original clause conferring a general power

 governments were to be destroyed and their liberties exterminated
 as the hideous monster whose devouring jaws would spare neither sex
 nor age nor high nor low nor sacred nor profane and yet strange
 as it may appear after all this clamor to those who may not have
 collect taxes what are the propermeans of executing such a power
 but necessary and proper laws
this simple train of inquiry furnishes us at once with a test by
 which to judge of the true nature of the clause complained of it
 declaration is predicated the declaration itself though it may be
 chargeable with tautology or redundancy is at least perfectly
 harmless
but suspicion may ask why then was it introduced the answer
 clause and i answer in the second place that the national
 government like every other must judge in the first instance of
 the proper exercise of its powers and its constituents in the last
 if the federal government should overpass the just bounds of its
 entirely due to those reasoners who in the imprudent zeal of their
 animosity to the plan of the convention have labored to envelop it
 in a cloud calculated to obscure the plainest and simplest truths
but it is said that the laws of the union are to be the supreme
 the land these will be merely acts of usurpation and will deserve
 to be treated as such hence we perceive that the clause which
 declares the supremacy of the laws of the union like the one we
 have just before considered only declares a truth which flows
 is to be hoped and presumed however that mutual interest would
 dictate a concert in this respect which would avoid any material
 inconvenience the inference from the whole is that the individual
 states would under the proposed constitution retain an independent

 be no color for the assertion that they would not possess means as
 abundant as could be desired for the supply of their own wants

 rome to disprove their existence it will be readily understood
 that i allude to the comitia centuriata and the comitia tributa
 the former in which the people voted by centuries was so arranged
 and those which will require a state provision we shall discover
 that the former are altogether unlimited and that the latter are
 circumscribed within very moderate bounds in pursuing this
 inquiry we must bear in mind that we are not to confine our view to
 state of absolute incapacity to provide for the protection of the
 community against future invasions of the public peace by foreign
 war or domestic convulsions if on the contrary we ought to
 exceed this point where can we stop short of an indefinite power

 upon us no reasonable man would hastily pronounce that we are
what are the chief sources of expense in every government what
 has occasioned that enormous accumulation of debts with which
 several of the european nations are oppressed the answers plainly
 is wars and rebellions the support of those institutions which
 are not a proper standard by which to judge of those which might be
 necessary in a republic it ought on the other hand to be remarked
 that there should be as great a disproportion between the profusion
 and extravagance of a wealthy kingdom in its domestic
 contingencies the total amount in every state ought to fall
 considerably short of two hundred thousand pounds
in framing a government for posterity as well as ourselves we
 ought in those provisions which are designed to be permanent to
 use of the states that would not either have been too much or too
 little too little for their present too much for their future
 wants as to the line of separation between external and internal
 taxes this would leave to the states at a rough computation the
 authority to that of the union any separation of the objects of
 revenue that could have been fallen upon would have amounted to a
 sacrifice of the great interests of the union to the power of the
 individual states the convention thought the concurrent
 particular objects it would naturally occasion an undue proportion
 of the public burdens to fall upon those objects two evils would
 spring from this source the oppression of particular branches of
 industry and an unequal distribution of the taxes as well among
 the last place they oppress the merchant who is often obliged to
 pay them himself without any retribution from the consumer when
 the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market the consumer
 generally pays the duty but when the markets happen to be
 them in the character of consumers in this view they are
 productive of inequality among the states which inequality would
 be increased with the increased extent of the duties the
 confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts
 import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be
 observed conformably to a remark made in another part of these
 papers that the interest of the revenue itself would be a
 sufficient guard against such an extreme i readily admit that this
 classes of citizens in order to combine the interests and feelings
 of every part of the community and to produce a due sympathy
 between the representative body and its constituents this argument
 presents itself under a very specious and seducing form and is
 discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and
 manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise
 and industry many of them indeed are immediately connected with
 the operations of commerce they know that the merchant is their
 they truly form no distinct interest in society and according to
 their situation and talents will be indiscriminately the objects of
 the confidence and choice of each other and of other parts of the
 community
 to choose a small or a large number their votes will fall upon
 those in whom they have most confidence whether these happen to be
 men of large fortunes or of moderate property or of no property at
 all
 will not the man of the learned profession who will feel a
 neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of
 industry be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them
 ready to promote either so far as it shall appear to him conducive
there is no part of the administration of government that
 requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of the
 principles of political economy so much as the business of taxation
 the man who understands those principles best will be least likely

 flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of state legislation
 but occasional instances of this sort will not render the reasoning
 founded upon the general course of things less conclusive
the subject might be placed in several other lights that would
 exercised with advantage as well from the want of a sufficient
 knowledge of local circumstances as from an interference between
 the revenue laws of the union and of the particular states the
 supposition of a want of proper knowledge seems to be entirely
 men or to boards composed of a few individuals who digest and
 prepare in the first instance the plans of taxation which are
 afterwards passed into laws by the authority of the sovereign or
 legislature
 must be few simple and easy to be comprehended the principal
 thing to be attended to would be to avoid those articles which had
 been previously appropriated to the use of a particular state and
 there could be no difficulty in ascertaining the revenue system of
 that cannot as well be performed by the national legislature as by a
 state legislature the attention of either can only reach to
 general principles local details as already observed must be
 referred to those who are to execute the plan
 writers on the side of the constitution that if the exercise of the
 power of internal taxation by the union should be discovered on
 experiment to be really inconvenient the federal government may
 then forbear the use of it and have recourse to requisitions in its
 an effectual expedient for this purpose will be mutually to
 abstain from those objects which either side may have first had
 recourse to as neither can control the other each will have an
 obvious and sensible interest in this reciprocal forbearance and
 applicable to a variety of objects in other cases the probability
 is that the united states will either wholly abstain from the
 objects preoccupied for local purposes or will make use of the
 state officers and state regulations for collecting the additional
 great question before the people they can answer no other end than
 to cast a mist over the truth
as to the suggestion of double taxation the answer is plain
 the wants of the union are to be supplied in one way or another
 the interest which the government has in the preservation of its own
 power coincides with a proper distribution of the public burdens
 and tends to guard the least wealthy part of the community from
 oppression
 from the possibility of such emergencies ought ever to have the
 option of making use of them the real scarcity of objects in this
 country which may be considered as productive sources of revenue
 is a reason peculiar to itself for not abridging the discretion of
 investigation under this head had it not been for the consideration
 that its organization and its extent may be more advantageously
 considered in connection this has determined me to refer it to the
 branch of our inquiries upon which we shall next enter
 examining it on all its sides comparing it in all its parts and
 calculating its probable effects
that this remaining task may be executed under impressions
 conducive to a just and fair result some reflections must in this
 an opposite predetermination or bias which must render their
 opinions also of little moment in the question in placing
 however these different characters on a level with respect to the
 weight of their opinions i wish not to insinuate that there may not
 find or to magnify faults but will see the propriety of
 reflecting that a faultless plan was not to be expected nor will
 they barely make allowances for the errors which may be chargeable
 on the fallibility to which the convention as a body of men were
 was to avoid the errors suggested by the past experience of other
 countries as well as of our own and to provide a convenient mode
 of rectifying their own errors as future experiences may unfold
 them
 people of this country enlightened as they are with regard to the
 nature and interested as the great body of them are in the
 effects of good government will never be satisfied till some remedy
 be applied to the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize
 cursory view here taken it must clearly appear to have been an
 arduous part
not less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper
 line of partition between the authority of the general and that of
 the commencement of the animal empire a still greater obscurity
 lies in the distinctive characters by which the objects in each of
 these great departments of nature have been arranged and assorted
when we pass from the works of nature in which all the
 precise extent of the common law and the statute law the maritime
 law the ecclesiastical law the law of corporations and other
 local laws and customs remains still to be clearly and finally
 established in great britain where accuracy in such subjects has
 not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas hence it
 must happen that however accurately objects may be discriminated in
 themselves and however accurately the discrimination may be
 considered the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the
 importance and that the latter would not be less tenacious of the
 equality at present enjoyed by them we may well suppose that
 neither side would entirely yield to the other and consequently
 that the struggle could be terminated only by compromise it is
 states are distinguished from each other by a variety of
 circumstances which produce a like effect on a larger scale and
 although this variety of interests for reasons sufficiently
 explained in a former paper may have a salutary influence on the
 repeated trials which have been unsuccessfully made in the united
 netherlands for reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their
 constitution the history of almost all the great councils and
 consultations held among mankind for reconciling their discordant
 the necessity of sacrificing private opinions and partial interests
 to the public good and by a despair of seeing this necessity
 diminished by delays or by new experiments

whence could it have proceeded that a people jealous as the

 carefully examined a consultation is held they are unanimously
 agreed that the symptoms are critical but that the case with
 proper and timely relief is so far from being desperate that it

 most fatal consequences do the monitors deny the reality of her

 are alarmed with the amazing expense from the number of persons who
 are to administer the new government from another quarter and
 sometimes from the same quarter on another occasion the cry is
 such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government
 and all the requisite precautions in favor of liberty whilst this
 objection circulates in vague and general expressions there are but
 a few who lend their sanction to it let each one come forward with
 judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error our
 principal dislike to the organization arises from the extensive
 powers already lodged in that department even among the zealous
 patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable variance is
 view it seriously even in fiction i leave it to be decided by the
 sample of opinions just exhibited whether with all their enmity to
 their predecessors they would in any one point depart so widely
 from their example as in the discord and ferment that would mark
 planned them but waiving illustrations of this sort is it not
 manifest that most of the capital objections urged against the new
 system lie with tenfold weight against the existing confederation
 is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of the

 the states have recognized to be the supreme law of the land is
 the importation of slaves permitted by the new constitution for
 twenty years by the old it is permitted forever
 states and although it is not of such a nature as to extricate
 them from their present distresses or for some time to come to
 yield any regular supplies for the public expenses yet must it
 hereafter be able under proper management both to effect a gradual
 indefinite number and appropriate money to their support for an
 indefinite period of time and yet there are men who have not only
 been silent spectators of this prospect but who are advocates for
 the system which exhibits it and at the same time urge against

the last paper having concluded the observations which were
 of the supreme authority is derived from the people has passed
 almost universally under the denomination of a republic the same
 title has been bestowed on venice where absolute power over the
 great body of the people is exercised in the most absolute manner
 tyrannical nobles exercising their oppressions by a delegation of
 their powers might aspire to the rank of republicans and claim for
 their government the honorable title of republic it is sufficient
 for such a government that the persons administering it be

on comparing the constitution planned by the convention with the
 standard here fixed we perceive at once that it is in the most
 rigid sense conformable to it the house of representatives like
 south carolina for two years in the other states the election is
 annual in several of the states however no constitutional
 provision is made for the impeachment of the chief magistrate and
 in delaware and virginia he is not impeachable till out of office
 is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was
 undertaken the handle which has been made of this objection
 requires that it should be examined with some precision
without inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which
 nation but as composing the distinct and independent states to
 which they respectively belong it is to be the assent and
 ratification of the several states derived from the supreme
 authority in each state the authority of the people themselves
 evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the united
 states neither of these rules have been adopted each state in
 ratifying the constitution is considered as a sovereign body
 independent of all others and only to be bound by its own voluntary
 eventual election again is to be made by that branch of the
 legislature which consists of the national representatives but in
 this particular act they are to be thrown into the form of
 individual delegations from so many distinct and coequal bodies
 people in their individual capacities in its ordinary and most
 essential proceedings may on the whole designate it in this
 relation a national government
but if the government be national with regard to the operation
 residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects it is
 true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two
 jurisdictions the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be
 established under the general government but this does not change
 to every alteration that would be binding on all the mode provided
 by the plan of the convention is not founded on either of these
 principles in requiring more than a majority and principles in
 requiring more than a majority and particularly in computing the

followingwhereas there is provision in the articles of
confederation and perpetual union for making alterations
therein by the assent of a congress of the united states and of
the legislatures of the several states and whereas experience
in these states a firm national government d that this
government was to be such as would be adequate to the exigencies
of government and the preservation of the union d that these
purposes were to be effected by alterations and provisions in the
should be sacrificed to the end rather than the end to the
means suppose then that the expressions defining the
authority of the convention were irreconcilably at variance with
each other that a national and adequate government could not
themselves originally aimed and to which they ought as
insufficient means to have been sacrificed but is it necessary
to suppose that these expressions are absolutely irreconcilable
to each other that no alterations or provisions in the articles
nor described its objects with so much latitude if some
substantial reform had not been in contemplation will it be said
that the fundamental principles of the confederation were not
within the purview of the convention and ought not to have been
different states and above all in the case of trials by
courtsmarshal in the army and navy by which death may be
inflicted without the intervention of a jury or even of a civil
magistrate in all these cases the powers of the confederation
beyond this limit the states should be left in possession of
their sovereignty and independence we have seen that in the new
government as in the old the general powers are limited and
that the states in all unenumerated cases are left in the

the fate of twelve states to the perverseness or corruption of a
thirteenth from the example of inflexible opposition given by a
majority of one sixtieth of the people of america to a measure
accordingly planned and proposed a constitution which is to be of
no more consequence than the paper on which it is written unless
it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom it is
addressed this reflection places the subject in a point of view
the proposition made by a single state virginia towards a
partial amendment of the confederation had been attended to and
promoted they had seen the liberty assumed by a very few
deputies from a very few states convened at annapolis of
citizen or number of citizens they must have recollected that it
was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the
people plans for their safety and happiness that the states
were first united against the danger with which they were

national exigencies had the convention under all these
impressions and in the midst of all these considerations
instead of exercising a manly confidence in their country by
which first urged and then complied with this unauthorized
interposition but that the objectors may be disarmed of every
pretext it shall be granted for a moment that the convention

candor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of
the government that the authors of them have very little
considered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining
a necessary end they have chosen rather to dwell on the
affirmative decision to guard as effectually as possible
against a perversion of the power to the public detriment that
we may form a correct judgment on this subject it will be proper
to review the several powers conferred on the government of the
enter into a proof of the affirmative the existing confederation
establishes this power in the most ample form is the power of
raising armies and equipping fleets necessary this is involved
in the foregoing power it is involved in the power of
rules and by no others it is in vain to oppose constitutional
barriers to the impulse of selfpreservation it is worse than in
vain because it plants in the constitution itself necessary
usurpations of power every precedent of which is a germ of
standing force therefore is a dangerous at the same time that
it may be a necessary provision on the smallest scale it has
its inconveniences on an extensive scale its consequences may be
fatal on any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection
extensive peace establishment the distance of the united states
from the powerful nations of the world gives them the same happy
security a dangerous establishment can never be necessary or
plausible so long as they continue a united people but let it
internal jealousies contentions and wars would form a part
only of her lot a plentiful addition of evils would have their
source in that relation in which europe stands to this quarter of
the earth and which no other quarter of the earth bears to
this critical period to two years this is the form in which the
comparison is usually stated to the public but is it a just
form is it a fair comparison does the british constitution
restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year does the
single year ought not suspicion herself to blush in pretending
that the representatives of the united states elected freely by
the whole body of the people every second year cannot be safely
intrusted with the discretion over such appropriations expressly
establishment that can become necessary under a united and
efficient government must be tolerable to the former and safe to
the latter the palpable necessity of the power to provide and
maintain a navy has protected that part of the constitution
to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of
those from whom it claims allegiance but to causes that are
fugitive and fallacious if we except perhaps virginia and
maryland which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern
the danger the object to be protected would be almost consumed
by the means of protecting them the power of regulating and
calling forth the militia has been already sufficiently
vindicated and explained the power of levying and borrowing

the importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers
multiply as soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands
not called for by agriculture the imported manufactures will
misconstruction had no other enumeration or definition of the
powers of the congress been found in the constitution than the
general expressions just cited the authors of the objection
might have had some color for it though it would have been
nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to
explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars but the idea
of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor
qualify the general meaning and can have no other effect than to
but what would have been thought of that assembly if attaching
themselves to these general expressions and disregarding the
specifications which ascertain and limit their import they had
exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense
importation of slaves and to lay an intermediate duty of ten
dollars per head as a discouragement to such importations this
class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the
federal administration if we are to be one nation in any
and receive consuls it is true that where treaties of commerce
stipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls whose functions
are connected with commerce the admission of foreign consuls may
fall within the power of making commercial treaties and that
the lesser than the more obvious and striking defects of the
old the power to define and punish piracies and felonies
committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of
nations belongs with equal propriety to the general government
codes of the several states would be as impracticable as the
former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide it is not
precisely the same in any two of the states and varies in each
with every revision of its criminal laws for the sake of
concurrence of the few states which continue the unnatural
traffic in the prohibitory example which has been given by so
great a majority of the union happy would it be for the
unfortunate africans if an equal prospect lay before them of
under this third description to wit to regulate commerce among
the several states and the indian tribes to coin money regulate
the value thereof and of foreign coin to provide for the
punishment of counterfeiting the current coin and secureties of
articles of import and export during the passage through their
jurisdiction with duties which would fall on the makers of the
latter and the consumers of the former we may be assured by past
experience that such a practice would be introduced by future
merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction into other
cantons without an augmentation of the tolls in germany it is a
law of the empire that the princes and states shall not lay
tolls or customs on bridges rivers or passages without the
legislative jurisdiction can be regulated by an external
authority without so far intruding on the internal rights of
legislation is absolutely incomprehensible this is not the only
case in which the articles of confederation have inconsiderately
like considerations with the preceding power of regulating coin
the dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been
remarked as a fault in our system and as laying a foundation for
intricate and delicate questions in the fourth article of the
state so that it may be in the power of a particular state or
rather every state is laid under a necessity not only to confer
the rights of citizenship in other states upon any whom it may
admit to such rights within itself but upon any whom it may
privilege of residence what would have been the consequence if
such persons by residence or otherwise had acquired the
character of citizens under the laws of another state and then
asserted their rights as such both to residence and citizenship
the articles of confederation the meaning of the latter is
extremely indeterminate and can be of little importance under
any interpretation which it will bear the power here established
may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice and be
exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries
the utility of this power will scarcely be questioned the
copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged in great
britain to be a right of common law the right to useful
the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings
interrupted with impunity but a dependence of the members of the
general government on the state comprehending the seat of the
government for protection in the exercise of their duty might
their own suffrages will of course be allowed them and as the
authority of the legislature of the state and of the inhabitants
of the ceded part of it to concur in the cession will be
derived from the whole people of the state in their adoption of
government have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on
each other the convention have with great judgment opposed a
barrier to this peculiar danger by inserting a constitutional
definition of the crime fixing the proof necessary for
states shall be formed without the concurrence of the federal
authority and that of the states concerned is consonant to the
principles which ought to govern such transactions the
particular precaution against the erection of new states by the
on republican principles and composed of republican members the
superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to
defend the system against aristocratic or monarchial
innovations the more intimate the nature of such a union may be
precaution and whether it may not become a pretext for
alterations in the state governments without the concurrence of
the states themselves these questions admit of ready answers if
the interposition of the general government should not be
which it is presumed will hardly be considered as a grievance
a protection against invasion is due from every society to the
parts composing it the latitude of the expression here used
seems to secure each state not only against foreign hostility
cases must be qualified by the lessons of practice why may not
illicit combinations for purposes of violence be formed as
well by a majority of a state especially a small state as by a
majority of a county or a district of the same state and if
succors from foreign powers as will render it superior also in
an appeal to the sword may not a more compact and advantageous
position turn the scale on the same side against a superior
number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and

such a remedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free
governments if a project equally effectual could be established
can only be considered as a declaratory proposition and may have
been inserted among other reasons for the satisfaction of the
foreign creditors of the united states who cannot be strangers
to the pretended doctrine that a change in the political form of
debts justly due to the public on the pretext here condemned 
to provide for amendments to be ratified by three fourths of
the states under two exceptions only that useful alterations
will be suggested by experience could not but be foreseen it
states ratifying the same this article speaks for itself
the express authority of the people alone could give due validity
to the constitution to have required the unanimous ratification
of the thirteen states would have subjected the essential
itself it has been heretofore noted among the defects of the
confederation that in many of the states it had received no
higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification the
principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation
dictate the second question is not less delicate and the
flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an
overcurious discussion of it it is one of those cases which must
be left to provide for itself in general it may be observed
several states no state shall enter into any treaty
alliance or confederation grant letters of marque and reprisal
coin money emit bills of credit make any thing but gold and
silver a legal tender in payment of debts pass any bill of
exclusive right of congress to regulate the alloy and value in
this instance also the new provision is an improvement on the
old whilst the alloy and value depended on the general
authority a right of coinage in the particular states could have
which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice
on the altar of justice of the power which has been the
instrument of it in addition to these persuasive
considerations it may be observed that the same reasons which
principles of the social compact and to every principle of sound
legislation the two former are expressly prohibited by the
declarations prefixed to some of the state constitutions and all
of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these
reform is wanting which will banish speculations on public
measures inspire a general prudence and industry and give a
regular course to the business of society the prohibition with
respect to titles of nobility is copied from the articles of
the states a reasonable discretion in providing for the
conveniency of their imports and exports and to the united
states a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion
the remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings
might have copied the second article of the existing
confederation which would have prohibited the exercise of any
power not expressly delegated they might have attempted a
positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general
with the alternative of betraying the public interests by doing
nothing or of violating the constitution by exercising powers
indispensably necessary and proper but at the same time not
expressly granted had the convention attempted a positive
happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the
excepted powers only that these would be such as would be least
likely to be assumed or tolerated because the enumeration would
of course select such as would be least necessary or proper and
not warranted by its true meaning i answer the same as if they
should misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them as
if the general power had been reduced to particulars and any one
of these were to be violated the same in short as if the state
of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof
and all treaties made or which shall be made under the
authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the
land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby any
every power contained in the proposed constitution in the third
place as the constitutions of the states differ much from each
other it might happen that a treaty or national law of great
and equal importance to the states would interfere with some and
with one which is obvious and conclusive the members of the
federal government will have no agency in carrying the state
constitutions into effect the members and officers of the state
governments on the contrary will have an essential agency in
not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the union

itself shall be preserved publius

contentions and wars among the different states if it be
essential to guard them against those violent and oppressive
factions which embitter the blessings of liberty and against
those military establishments which must gradually poison its
too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the
public good the real welfare of the great body of the people is
the supreme object to be pursued and that no form of government
whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the
members to despoil the general government of its authorities
with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself
against the encroachments although in most of these examples
the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration
ligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the
head and to each other in the feudal system we have seen a
similar propensity exemplified notwithstanding the want of
proper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns
of the former without the intervention of the state
legislatures the president of the united states cannot be
elected at all they must in all cases have a great share in his
appointment and will perhaps in most cases of themselves
of the former than of the latter the members of the legislative
executive and judiciary departments of thirteen and more states
the justices of peace officers of militia ministerial officers
of justice with all the county corporation and town officers
numerous the advantage in this view also lies on the same side
it is true that the confederacy is to possess and may exercise
the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes
throughout the states but it is probable that this power will
side of the state the powers delegated by the proposed
constitution to the federal government are few and defined those
which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and
indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external
new powers to the union than in the invigoration of its original
powers the regulation of commerce it is true is a new power
but that seems to be an addition which few oppose and from which
no apprehensions are entertained the powers relating to war and
consolidation to maintain that such an event would have ensued
would be to say at once that the existence of the state
governments is incompatible with any system whatever that
accomplishes the essental purposes of the union publius 
subject and to have viewed these different establishments not
only as mutual rivals and enemies but as uncontrolled by any
common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each
other these gentlemen must here be reminded of their error they
with the members of these will a greater proportion of the
people have the ties of personal acquaintance and friendship and
of family and party attachments on the side of these
therefore the popular bias may well be expected most strongly to
as has been elsewhere remarked the people should in future
become more partial to the federal than to the state governments
the change can only result from such manifest and irresistible
proofs of a better administration as will overcome all their
but in a distinct and very important point of view the advantage
will lie on the same side the prepossessions which the members
themselves will carry into the federal government will generally
be favorable to the states whilst it will rarely happen that
themselves too much to local objects the states will be to the
latter what counties and towns are to the former measures will
too often be decided according to their probable effect not on
the national prosperity and happiness but on the prejudices
spirit of both to be disinclined to invade the rights of the
individual states or the preorgatives of their governments the
motives on the part of the state governments to augment their
prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government will be
may sometimes be the case the means of opposition to it are
powerful and at hand the disquietude of the people their
repugnance and perhaps refusal to cooperate with the officers
of the union the frowns of the executive magistracy of the
other but what degree of madness could ever drive the federal
government to such an extremity in the contest with great
britain one part of the empire was employed against the other
the more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous
extension of the military establishment that the governments
and the people of the states should silently and patiently behold
the gathering storm and continue to supply the materials until
it should be prepared to burst on their own heads must appear to
and conducted by governments possessing their affections and
confidence it may well be doubted whether a militia thus
circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of
regular troops those who are best acquainted with the last
be affirmed with the greatest assurance that the throne of every
tyranny in europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the
legions which surround it let us not insult the free and gallant
citizens of america with the suspicion that they would be less
they seem to amount to the most convincing evidence that the
powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as
little formidable to those reserved to the individual states as
they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of
departments ought to be separate and distinct in the structure
of the federal government no regard it is said seems to have
been paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty the
several departments of power are distributed and blended in such
order to form correct ideas on this important subject it will be
proper to investigate the sense in which the preservation of
liberty requires that the three great departments of power should
be separate and distinct the oracle who is always consulted and
                         on the slightest view of the british
constitution we must perceive that the legislative executive
and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and
distinct from each other the executive magistrate forms an
or body of magistrates or if the power of judging be not
separated from the legislative and executive powers he did not
mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency in
or no control over the acts of each other his meaning as his
they may be advised with by the legislative councils the entire
legislature can perform no judiciary act though by the joint act
of two of its branches the judges may be removed from their
offices and though one of its branches is possessed of the

if we look into the constitutions of the several states we find
that notwithstanding the emphatical and in some instances the
in all cases has a casting vote in case of a tie the executive
head is himself eventually elective every year by the
legislative department and his council is every year chosen by
and from the members of the same department several of the
the senate which is a part of the legislature is a court of
impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary
departments the members of the judiciary department again are
appointable by the executive department and removable by the
control in its council of appointment members of the
legislative are associated with the executive authority in the
appointment of officers both executive and judiciary and its
court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is
officers judiciary as well as executive the judges of the
supreme court and justices of the peace seem also to be removable
by the legislature and the executive power of pardoning in
certain cases to be referred to the same department the members
government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each
other her constitution notwithstanding makes the executive
magistrate appointable by the legislative department and the
members of the judiciary by the executive department the
distinct from each other refers at the same time to the
legislative department the appointment not only of the executive
chief but all the principal officers within both that and the
judiciary department in south carolina the constitution makes
excellent principles which they exemplify they carry strong
marks of the haste and still stronger of the inexperience under
which they were framed it is but too obvious that in some
instances the fundamental principle under consideration has been
examined does not require that the legislative executive and
judiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each
other i shall undertake in the next place to show that unless
these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to
boundaries of these departments in the constitution of the
government and to trust to these parchment barriers against the
encroaching spirit of power this is the security which appears
to have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of
executive usurpations in a government where numerous and
extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary
monarch the executive department is very justly regarded as the
source of danger and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal
our governments from other circumstances its constitutional
powers being at once more extensive and less susceptible of
precise limits it can with the greater facility mask under
complicated and indirect measures the encroachments which it
without end i might find a witness in every citizen who has
shared in or been attentive to the course of public
administrations i might collect vouchers in abundance from the
records and archives of every state in the union but as a more
surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn
their eyes on the republic of venice as little will it avail us
that they are chosen by ourselves an elective despotism was not
the government we fought for but one which should not only be
have accordingly in many instances decided rights which should
have been left to judiciary controversy and the direction of the
executive during the whole time of their session is becoming
habitual and familiar the other state which i shall take for
shall be previously printed for the consideration of the people
although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the
constitution against improper acts of legislature the
constitutional trial by jury had been violated and powers
most of the other instances they conformed either to the
declared or the known sentiments of the legislative department

distinguished from that of the other states by the number of

the author of the notes on the state of virginia quoted in
altering the constitution or correcting breaches of it a

the only legitimate fountain of power and it is from them that

the proposed recurrence to the people as a provision in all
cases for keeping the several departments of power within their
constitutional limits in the first place the provision does not
practical influence on his conduct depend much on the number
which he supposes to have entertained the same opinion the
reason of man like man himself is timid and cautious when left
alone and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the
unnecessarily multiplied we are to recollect that all the
existing constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which
repressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord of
an enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic
different situations the members of the executive and judiciary
departments are few in number and can be personally known to a
small part only of the people the latter by the mode of their
appointment as well as by the nature and permanency of it are
should not be the case with all it would probably be the case
with many and pretty certainly with those leading characters on
whom every thing depends in such bodies the convention in
short would be composed chiefly of men who had been who
agents in or opponents of the measures to which the decision
would relate the passions therefore not the reason of the
public would sit in judgment but it is the reason alone of the
public that ought to control and regulate the government the
them periodical appeals are the proper and adequate means of
preventing and correcting infractions of the constitution it
will be attended to that in the examination of these expedients
i confine myself to their aptitude for enforcing the
or two hundred members eagerly bent on some favorite object and
breaking through the restraints of the constitution in pursuit of
it would be arrested in their career by considerations drawn
from a censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance
to remark as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the
reasoning which i have employed first it appears from the
names of the gentlemen who composed the council that some at
least of its most active members had also been active and
themselves or unconnected with each other the same names stand
invariably contrasted on the opposite columns every unbiased
observer may infer without danger of mistake and at the same
time without meaning to reflect on either party or any
same time by its researches the existence of the disease and
by its example the inefficacy of the remedy this conclusion
cannot be invalidated by alleging that the state in which the
experiment was made was at that crisis and had been for a long
in the parties connected with these measures and have been

the structure of the government must furnish the proper checks
that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of
government which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to
be essential to the preservation of liberty it is evident that
each department should have a will of its own and consequently
permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that
department must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the
authority conferring them it is equally evident that the
members of each department should be as little dependent as
controls on government would be necessary in framing a
government which is to be administered by men over men the great
difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to
control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control
different principles of action as little connected with each
other as the nature of their common functions and their common
dependence on the society will admit it may even be necessary
to guard against dangerous encroachments by still further
will be found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond
with them the former are infinitely less able to bear such a
test there are moreover two considerations particularly
applicable to the federal system of america which place that
providing against this evil the one by creating a will in the
community independent of the majority that is of the society
itself the other by comprehending in the society so many
separate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust
the number of interests and sects and this may be presumed to
depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended
under the same government this view of the subject must
particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere
as well as themselves so in the former state will the more
powerful factions or parties be gradnally induced by a like
motive to wish for a government which will protect all parties
the weaker as well as the more powerful it can be little
entertained that the larger the society provided it lie within
a practical sphere the more duly capable it will be of
selfgovernment and happily for the republican cause the
practicable sphere may be carried to a very great extent by a
this right in the constitution to have left it open for the
occasional regulation of the congress would have been improper
for the reason just mentioned to have submitted it to the
legislative discretion of the states would have been improper
constitutions and being at the same time more susceptible of
uniformity have been very properly considered and regulated by
the convention a representative of the united states must be of
the age of twentyfive years must have been seven years a
unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and
sympathy can be effectually secured but what particular degree
of frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose does
not appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation and must
sessions were left so much at the discretion of the monarch
that under various pretexts very long and dangerous
intermissions were often contrived by royal ambition to remedy
this grievance it was provided by a statute in the reign of
from the degree of liberty retained even under septennial
elections and all the other vicious ingredients in the
parliamentary constitution we cannot doubt that a reduction of
the period from seven to three years with the other necessary
have been broken and octennial parliaments have besides been
established what effect may be produced by this partial reform
must be left to further experience the example of ireland from
this view of it can throw but little light on the subject as
to independence is the best of proofs that a sufficient portion
of liberty had been everywhere enjoyed to inspire both a sense of
its worth and a zeal for its proper enlargement this remark holds
good as well with regard to the then colonies whose elections
and which with a few exceptions was exercised by the colonial
assemblies and the irish legislature it is a received and
wellfounded maxim that where no other circumstances affect the
case the greater the power is the shorter ought to be its

i shall here perhaps be reminded of a current observation
the rule on one side why not also on the other side turning our
attention to the periods established among ourselves for the
election of the most numerous branches of the state legislatures
we find them by no means coinciding any more in this instance
other country wherever the supreme power of legislation has
resided has been supposed to reside also a full power to change
the form of the government even in great britain where the
principles of political and civil liberty have been most
could be obtained no constitutional security similar to that
established in the united states was to be attempted some
other security therefore was to be sought for and what better
security would the case admit than that of selecting and
biennial elections be necessary or useful the propriety of
answering this question in the affirmative will appear from
several very obvious considerations                             
                                         no man can be a
single state the requisite knowledge relates to the existing
laws which are uniform throughout the state and with which all
the citizens are more or less conversant and to the general
affairs of the state which lie within a small compass are not
be judiciously imposed and effectually collected if they be not
accommodated to the different laws and local circumstances
relating to these objects in the different states how can
uniform regulations for the militia be duly provided without a
assimilation of their manners and laws but with all these
abatements the business of federal legislation must continue so
far to exceed both in novelty and difficulty the legislative
business of a single state as to justify the longer period of
derived from the public sources of information and all of it
will be acquired to best effect by a practical attention to the
subject during the period of actual service in the legislature
there are other considerations of less importance perhaps but
remark is no less applicable to the relation which will subsist
between the house of representatives and the senate it is an
inconvenience mingled with the advantages of our frequent
elections even in single states where they are large and hold
considerations taken together warrant us in affirming that
biennial elections will be as useful to the affairs of the public
as we have seen that they will be safe to the liberty of the
people publius 
in the latter it has reference to the proportion of wealth of
which it is in no case a precise measure and in ordinary cases a
very unfit one but notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule
as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the
this distinction to the case of our slaves but we must deny the
fact that slaves are considered merely as property and in no
respect whatever as persons the true state of the case is that
they partake of both these qualities being considered by our
character it is the character bestowed on them by the laws
under which they live and it will not be denied that these are
the proper criterion because it is only under the pretext that
the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property
property a part of their human brethren should themselves
contend that the government to which all the states are to be
parties ought to consider this unfortunate race more completely
in the unnatural light of property than the very laws of which
certain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by
the constitution of the state who will be included in the census
by which the federal constitution apportions the representatives
in this point of view the southern states might retort the
hitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to
persons only and not at all to property but is it a just idea
government is instituted no less for protection of the property
than of the persons of individuals the one as well as the
frequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his
choice and through this imperceptible channel the rights of
property are conveyed into the public representation a state
possesses no such influence over other states it is not probable
constitution the federal acts will take effect without the
necessary intervention of the individual states they will depend
merely on the majority of votes in the federal legislature and
consequently each vote whether proceeding from a larger or
the cooperation of the states it is of great importance that
the states should feel as little bias as possible to swell or to
reduce the amount of their numbers were their share of
representation alone to be governed by this rule they would have
number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the
public interests secondly that they will not possess a proper
knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous
constituents thirdly that they will be taken from that class of
three and four hundred a very considerable difference is
observable among states nearly equal in population the number of
representatives in pennsylvania is not more than one fifth of
that in the state last mentioned new york whose population is
would reduce the representative assembly of the latter to seven
or eight members nothing can be more fallacious than to found
our political calculations on arithmetical principles sixty or
seventy men may be more properly trusted with a given degree of
justify less frequent elections than the public safely might
otherwise require the members of the congress need be less
numerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation
and were under no other than the ordinary restraints of other
twentyfive years according to the computed rate of increase
the number of representatives will amount to two hundred and of
fifty years to four hundred this is a number which i presume
will put an end to all fears arising from the smallness of the
circumstances which can speedily happen will choose and every
second year repeat the choice of sixtyfive or a hundred men who
would be disposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or
treachery i am unable to conceive that the state legislatures
could so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable them to
ensnare and betray their constituents how has it happened that
we are at this time a free and independent nation the congress
which conducted us through the revolution was a less numerous
but where are the means to be found by the president or the
senate or both their emoluments of office it is to be
presumed will not and without a previous corruption of the
house of representatives cannot more than suffice for very
such as may become vacant by ordinary casualties and to suppose
that these would be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the
people selected by the people themselves is to renounce every
rule by which events ought to be calculated and to substitute an

trust in determining the extent of information required in the
exercise of a particular authority recourse then must be had to
the objects within the purview of that authority what are to be
the objects of federal legislation those which are of most
state framed by representatives from every part of it will be
almost of themselves a sufficient guide in every state there
have been made and must continue to be made regulations on this
subject which will in many cases leave little more to be done
advantage from another circumstance the representatives of each
state will not only bring with them a considerable knowledge of
its laws and a local knowledge of their respective districts
but will probably in all cases have been members and may even at
different states taking each state by itself its laws are the
same and its interests but little diversified a few men
therefore will possess all the knowledge requisite for a proper
representation of them were the interests and affairs of each
a variety and complexity to the affairs of a nation these
however will in all of them be the fruits of a more advanced
population and will require on the part of each state a fuller
representation the foresight of the convention has accordingly
contrary it is notorious that they are more frequently the
representatives and instruments of the executive magistrate than
the guardians and advocates of the popular rights they might
therefore with great propriety be considered as something more
the ignorance of the legislature concerning the circumstances of
the people allowing to this case the weight which is due to it
and comparing it with that of the house of representatives as
above explained it seems to give the fullest assurance that a
oligarchy the principle of it strikes at the very root of
republican government the aim of every political constitution
is or ought to be first to obtain for rulers men who possess
most wisdom to discern and most virtue to pursue the common
distinguished names more than the humble sons of obscurity and
unpropitious fortune the electors are to be the great body of
the people of the united states they are to be the same who
exercise the right in every state of electing the corresponding
every breast a sensibility to marks of honor of favor of
esteem and of confidence which apart from all considerations
of interest is some pledge for grateful and benevolent returns
ingratitude is a common topic of declamation against human
members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the
people before the sentiments impressed on their minds by the
mode of their elevation can be effaced by the exercise of power
they will be compelled to anticipate the moment when their power
laws and above all the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates
the people of america a spirit which nourishes freedom and in
return is nourished by it if this spirit shall ever be so far
debased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature
their own rulers yet maintain that they will prefer those only
who will immediately and infallibly betray the trust committed to
them were the objection to be read by one who had not seen the
mode prescribed by the constitution for the choice of
thousand citizens are less capable of choosing a fit
representative or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one
than five or six hundred reason on the contrary assures us
that as in so great a number a fit representative would be most
possess a like estate of half that annual value to this
qualification on the part of the county representatives is added
another on the part of the county electors which restrains the
right of suffrage to persons having a freehold estate of the
elector at the same time if the same electors at the same time
are capable of choosing four or five representatives they cannot
be incapable of choosing one pennsylvania is an additional
example some of her counties which elect her state
places than the representatives and magistrates appointed in
other states by very small divisions of the people but there are
cases of a stronger complexion than any which i have yet quoted
one branch of the legislature of connecticut is so constituted
following observations will show that like most other objections
against the constitution it can only proceed from a partial view
of the subject or from a jealousy which discolors and disfigures
every object which is beheld  those who urge the objection
the most effectual security in any of them is resolvable into a
mere directory provision  as far as experience has taken place
on this subject a gradual increase of representatives under the
state constitutions has at least kept pace with that of the
will be sufficient to overrule the opposition a coalition which
notwithstanding the rivalship and local prejudices which might
prevent it on ordinary occasions would not fail to take place
when not merely prompted by common interest but justified by
the two houses this advantage must be increased by the
consciousness felt by the same side of being supported in its
demands by right by reason and by the constitution and the
consciousness on the opposite side of contending against the
mutually conditions of each other and the senators from all the
most growing states will be bound to contend for the latter by
the interest which their states will feel in the former these
considerations seem to afford ample security on this subject and
the people for obtaining a redress of every grievance and for
carrying into effect every just and salutary measure but will
not the house of representatives be as much interested as the
senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions and
been apprehended nor experienced the utmost degree of firmness
that can be displayed by the federal senate or president will
not be more than equal to a resistance in which they will be
supported by constitutional and patriotic principles in this
greater will be the proportion of members of limited information
and of weak capacities now it is precisely on characters of
this description that the eloquence and address of the few are
known to act with all their force in the ancient republics
fewer and often the more secret will be the springs by which
its motions are directed as connected with the objection against
the number of representatives may properly be here noticed that
which has been suggested against the number made competent for
the baneful practice of secessions a practice which has shown
itself even in states where a majority only is required a
practice subversive of all the principles of order and regular
government a practice which leads more directly to public
against by those who condemn the constitution in the gross but
it has been censured by those who have objected with less
latitude and greater moderation and in one instance it has been
thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the
probable change in the situation of the country and it will
therefore not be denied that a discretionary power over
elections ought to exist somewhere it will i presume be as
readily conceded that there were only three ways in which this
a neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take
place the constitutional possibility of the thing without an
equivalent for the risk is an unanswerable objection nor has
any satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that
apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the
national government in a similar respect to the pleasure of the
state governments an impartial view of the matter cannot fail
to result in a conviction that each as far as possible ought
one instance they ought to have it in every other there are
cases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far
more decisive without any motive equally cogent with that which
must have regulated the conduct of the convention in respect to
representatives than from their power of appointing the members
of its senate the senators are to be chosen for the period of
six years there is to be a rotation by which the seats of a
third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two
regulating these elections every period of making them would be
a delicate crisis in the national situation which might issue in
a dissolution of the union if the leaders of a few of the most
important states should have entered into a previous conspiracy

 rendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in
 the choice of all chimerical suppositions this seems to be the
 most chimerical on the one hand no rational calculation of
 probabilities would lead us to imagine that the disposition which a
in addition to this general reflection there are considerations
 of a more precise nature which forbid all apprehension on the
 subject the dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose
 the national government and ustill more in the manner in which they
 to cement these different branches in a predilection for any
 particular class of electors
as to the senate it is impossible that any regulation of time
 and manner which is all that is proposed to be submitted to the
 the national councils is it to be exercised in a discrimination
 between the different departments of industry or between the
 different kinds of property or between the different degrees of
 property will it lean in favor of the landed interest or the

 its empire and in most of them has a considerable share of

 into the national representation and for the very reason that

 situation must have the same effect in the primative composition at
 least of the federal house of representatives an improper bias
 towards the mercantile class is as little to be expected from this

 sense of duty or an apprehension of the danger of the experiment

 decisive act of usurpation than to trust to precarious expedients
 which in spite of all the precautions that might accompany them
 might terminate in the dismission disgrace and ruin of their
 authors would they not fear that citizens not less tenacious than
 qualification however that it ought to have been accompanied with
 a declaration that all elections should be had in the counties
 where the electors resided this say they was a necessary
 precaution against an abuse of the power a declaration of this
 situation in this particular would tend greatly to remove any ill
 impressions which may remain in regard to this matter but as that
 view would lead into long and tedious details i shall content
 myself with the single example of the state in which i write the
 to come to the city of albany to give their votes for members of
 the assembly or senate sooner than they would repair to the city of
 new york to participate in the choice of the members of the federal
 house of representatives the alarming indifference discoverable in
 imputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be applicable to
 them also the presumption is that they are rather the cavilling
 refinements of a predetermined opposition than the wellfounded
 inferences of a candid research after truth to those who are
 distinguishable from each other by a diversity of local
 circumstances prejudices and interests
hitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the
 provision in question on the ground of theoretic propriety on that
 spirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members as they
 come forward in succession the mass would be likely to remain
 nearly the same assimilating constantly to itself its gradual
 accretions there is a contagion in example which few men have
 appointed it might upon experiment have been found less
 convenient than some other time the same answer may be given to
 the question put on the other side and it may be added that the
 supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative it
 representation in the senate iv the number of senators and the
 term for which they are to be elected v the powers vested in the
 senate
i the qualifications proposed for senators as distinguished
ii it is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of
 senators by the state legislatures among the various modes which
 might have been devised for constituting this branch of the
 government that which has been proposed by the convention is
 of the principles of proportional and equal representation but it
 is superfluous to try by the standard of theory a part of the
 constitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result not of
 theory but of a spirit of amity and that mutual deference and
 states since they are not less solicitous to guard by every
 possible expedient against an improper consolidation of the states
 into one simple republic
another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the
 appointment come next to be considered in order to form an
 accurate judgment on both of these points it will be proper to
 inquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate and
 in order to ascertain these it will be necessary to review the
 distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will
 consist with a due harmony in all proper measures and with the
 genuine principles of republican government
secondly the necessity of a senate is not less indicated
 the affairs and the comprehensive interests of their country
 should if left wholly to themselves escape a variety of important
 errors in the exercise of their legislative trust it may be
 affirmed on the best grounds that no small share of the present
 which increases the security for the first
fourthly the mutability in the public councils arising
 from a rapid succession of new members however qualified they may
 be points out in the strongest manner the necessity of some

 not a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of
 his one nation is to another what one individual is to another

 action but how can that be a rule which is little known and less
 fixed
 encouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment
 when he can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and
 advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant government
 in a word no great improvement or laudable enterprise can go
 stable member of the government the esteem of foreign powers will
 not only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy
 proceeding from the causes already mentioned but the national
 councils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the
 and changeable body it can only be found in a number so small that
 a sensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be
 the portion of each individual or in an assembly so durably
 invested with public trust that the pride and consequence of its
 objects within the power of the responsible party and in order to
 be effectual must relate to operations of that power of which a
 ready and proper judgment can be formed by the constituents the
 objects of government may be divided into two general classes the
 immediate detached and palpable operation on its constituents
the proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in
 the legislative department which having sufficient permanency to
 provide for such objects as require a continued attention and a
 citizens in order to check the misguided career and to suspend the
 blow meditated by the people against themselves until reason
 justice and truth can regain their authority over the public mind
 what bitter anguish would not the people of athens have often
 interested men may succeed in distributing among them
it adds no small weight to all these considerations to
 recollect that history informs us of no longlived republic which
 had not a senate sparta rome and carthage are in fact the only
 maintained that there are many points of similitude which render
 these examples not unworthy of our attention many of the defects
 as we have seen which can only be supplied by a senatorial
 institution are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by
 of representation is by no means precisely true in the latitude
 commonly given to it without entering into a disquisition which
 here would be misplaced i will refer to a few known facts in
 support of what i advance
lastly in sparta we meet with the ephori and in rome with the
 tribunes two bodies small indeed in numbers but annually elected
 by the whole body of the people and considered as the
 representatives of the people almost in their plenipotentiary
 that any form of representative government could have succeeded
 within the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of greece
in answer to all these arguments suggested by reason
 illustrated by examples and enforced by our own experience the
 attempt an establishment of tyranny without corrupting the state
 legislatures it cannot prosecute the attempt because the
 periodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole
 body without exerting the means of corruption with equal success
 would expose the former to colorable objections that do not lie
 against the latter if the federal senate therefore really
 contained the danger which has been so loudly proclaimed some
 symptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time to have been
 are at some future period to be exemplified in the united states
 unfortunately however for the antifederal argument the british
 history informs us that this hereditary assembly has not been able
 to defend itself against the continual encroachments of the house of
 had at the commencement of the second punic war lost almost the
 whole of its original portion
besides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage
 of facts that the federal senate will never be able to transform
to the people of the state of new york
it is a just and not a new observation that enemies to
 particular persons and opponents to particular measures seldom
 confine their censures to such things only in either as are worthy
 vastly the advantage of elections by the people in their collective
 capacity where the activity of party zeal taking the advantage of
 the supineness the ignorance and the hopes and fears of the unwary
 and interested often places men in office by the votes of a small
 means of extensive and accurate information relative to men and
 characters so will their appointments bear at least equal marks of
 discretion and discernment the inference which naturally results
 from these considerations is this that the president and senators
 concert and to execute it was wise therefore in the convention
 to provide not only that the power of making treaties should be
 committed to able and honest men but also that they should continue
 in place a sufficient time to become perfectly acquainted with our
 see and confess that it is well provided for by making concurrence
 of the senate necessary both to treaties and to laws
it seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties of whatever
 nature but that perfect secrecy and immediate despatch are
 who preside over them and they who have had much experience on
 this head inform us that there frequently are occasions when days
 nay even when hours are precious the loss of a battle the death
 of a prince the removal of a minister or other circumstances
 investigations on the one hand and from secrecy and despatch on
 the other
but to this plan as to most others that have ever appeared
 objections are contrived and urged
 affected
others though content that treaties should be made in the mode
 proposed are averse to their being the supreme laws of the land
 they insist and profess to believe that treaties like acts of
however useful jealousy may be in republics yet when like bile
 in the natural it abounds too much in the body politic the eyes of
 both become very liable to be deceived by the delusive appearances
 which that malady casts on surrounding objects from this cause
 which compose the whole it will not be in the power of the
 president and senate to make any treaties by which they and their
 families and estates will not be equally bound and affected with the
 rest of the community and having no private interests distinct
 treaties they make will be as advantageous as all circumstances
 considered could be made and so far as the fear of punishment and
 disgrace can operate that motive to good behavior is amply afforded
 by the article on the subject of impeachments
 object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a
 government wholly elective the subjects of its jurisdiction are
 those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men or
 in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust
 will from that circumstance be too often the leaders or the tools
 of the most cunning or the most numerous faction and on this
 account can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality
 towards those whose conduct may be the subject of scrutiny
 the house of commons to prefer the impeachment and of the house of
 lords to decide upon it several of the state constitutions have
 followed the example as well the latter as the former seem to
 have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands
 their immediate representatives a deficiency in the first would
 be fatal to the accused in the last dangerous to the public
 tranquillity the hazard in both these respects could only be
 avoided if at all by rendering that tribunal more numerous than
 this conclusion it is this the punishment which may be the
 consequence of conviction upon impeachment is not to terminate the
 chastisement of the offender after having been sentenced to a
 prepetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence and honors and
 disqualification for a future office it may be said that the
 intervention of a jury in the second instance would obviate the
 danger but juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of
 judges they are sometimes induced to find special verdicts which
 would have afforded
would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the
 trial of impeachments of persons wholly distinct from the other
 departments of the government there are weighty arguments as well
 seriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over
 the whole union the injury to the innocent from the
 procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought
 against them the advantage to the guilty from the opportunities
 opinions of a whole commuity in the same judgment of it and to
 prevail upon one conceited projector to renounce his infallible
 criterion for the fallible criterion of his more conceited neighbor
 to answer the purpose of the adversaries of the constitution they
 violation of that important and wellestablished maxim which requires
 a separation between the different departments of power the true
 meaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another
 place and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial
 be requisite to a condemnation the security to innocence from this
 additional circumstance will be as complete as itself can desire
it is curious to observe with what vehemence this part of the
 plan is assailed on the principle here taken notice of by men who
 appointment to offices if say the objectors to these
 prerogatives is added that of deciding in all cases of impeachment
 it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial influence to an
 objection so little precise in itself it is not easy to find a very
 inconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy if
 practicable to find a more fit receptacle for the power of
 determining impeachments than that which has been chosen if this
 be truly the case the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of
 the umpire in all elections of the president which do not unite the
 suffrages of a majority of the whole number of electors a case
 which it cannot be doubted will sometimes if not frequently happen 
 the constant possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of
 contradiction to this principle proceeds upon the presumption that
 the responsibility of those who appoint for the fitness and
 competency of the persons on whom they bestow their choice and the
 interest they will have in the respectable and prosperous
 another but they cannot themselves choose they can only ratify or
 reject the choice of the president they might even entertain a
 preference to some other person at the very moment they were
 assenting to the one proposed because there might be no positive
 the treachery of which they have been guilty
this objection has been circulated with more earnestness and
 with greater show of reason than any other which has appeared
 against this part of the plan and yet i am deceived if it does not
 treaty than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the
 national legislature consenting to a pernicious or unconstitutional
 law a principle which i believe has never been admitted into any
 government how in fact could a majority in the house of

 body to punish the abuse of their confidence or to vindicate their
 own authority we may thus far count upon their pride if not upon
 their virtue and so far even as might concern the corruption of

the constitution of the executive department of the proposed
 government claims next our attention
there is hardly any part of the system which could have been
 throne surrounded with minions and mistresses giving audience to
 the envoys of foreign potentates in all the supercilious pomp of
 majesty the images of asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have
 scarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated scene we have been
 give place to a voluntary and unreserved indignation it is
 impossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and
 deception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of
 great britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that
 empowers the president of the united states to nominate and by
 and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint
 ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the
 supreme court and all other officers of united states whose
 this position will hardly be contested
the last of these two clauses it is equally clear cannot be
 understood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the
 senate for the following reasons  first the relation in
 one and this we have seen excludes from its description the
 members of the senate thirdly the time within which the
 power is to operate during the recess of the senate and the
 duration of the appointments to the end of the next session of
 president but lastly the first and second clauses of the
 third section of the first article not only obviate all possibility
 of doubt but destroy the pretext of misconception the former
 provides that the senate of the united states shall be composed
 an unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are practiced
 to prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the
 constitution submitted to the consideration of the people nor have
 i scrupled in so flagrant a case to allow myself a severity of
 slightest mark of approbation from its opponents the most
 plausible of these who has appeared in print has even deigned to
 admit that the election of the president is pretty well
 guarded i venture somewhat further and hesitate not to
 as possible to tumult and disorder this evil was not least to be
 dreaded in the election of a magistrate who was to have so
 important an agency in the administration of the government as the
 president of the united states but the precautions which have been
 magistracy of the union but the convention have guarded against
 all danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious
 attention they have not made the appointment of the president to
 depend on any preexisting bodies of men who might be tampered with
 though they could not properly be denominated corrupt might yet be
 of a nature to mislead them from their duty
another and no less important desideratum was that the
 executive should be independent for his continuance in office on all
 a contingency the house of representatives shall select out of the
 candidates who shall have the five highest number of votes the man
 who in their opinion may be best qualified for the office
the process of election affords a moral certainty that the
 yet we may safely pronounce that the true test of a good
 government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good
 administration
the vicepresident is to be chosen in the same manner with the
 election prescribed for the one apply with great if not with equal
 force to the manner of appointing the other it is remarkable that
 in this as in most other instances the objection which is made
 would lie against the constitution of this state we have a
the first thing which strikes our attention is that the
 executive authority with few exceptions is to be vested in a
 single magistrate this will scarcely however be considered as a
 point upon which any comparison can be grounded for if in this
 duration of three years for a corresponding office in a single state
the president of the united states would be liable to be
 impeached tried and upon conviction of treason bribery or other
 high crimes or misdemeanors removed from office and would
 crowns having found the means of substituting influence to
 authority or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of
 the two houses to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which
 could seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national
 of the legislature or either of them and in case of disagreement
 between them with respect to the time of adjournment to adjourn
 them to such time as he shall think proper to take care that the
 laws be faithfully executed and to commission all officers of the
 to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies all which by
 the constitution under consideration would appertain to the
 legislature the governor of new york on the other hand is
 by the constitution of the state vested only with the command of its
 and adherents an entire impunity a president of the union on the
 other hand though he may even pardon treason when prosecuted in
 the ordinary course of law could shelter no offender in any
 degree from the effects of impeachment and conviction would not
 the governor of new york may also prorogue the legislature of this
 state for a limited time a power which in certain situations may
 be employed to very important purposes
the president is to have power with the advice and consent of
 birth to the imagination that its cooperation was necessary to the
 obligatory efficacy of the treaty but this parliamentary
 interposition proceeds from a different cause from the necessity
 of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and
 administration of the government and it was far more convenient
 that it should be arranged in this manner than that there should be
 a necessity of convening the legislature or one of its branches
 upon every arrival of a foreign minister though it were merely to
 nomination and is entitled to a casting vote in the appointment
 if he really has the right of nominating his authority is in this
 respect equal to that of the president and exceeds it in the
 article of the casting vote in the national government if the
 more or less power than the governor of new york and it appears
 yet more unequivocally that there is no pretense for the parallel
 which has been attempted between him and the king of great britain
 but to render the contrast in this respect still more striking it

to the people of the state of new york
there is an idea which is not without its advocates that a
 vigorous executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican
 as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the
 conquest and destruction of rome
there can be no need however to multiply arguments or examples
 on this head a feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the
 celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice
 of their views have declared in favor of a single executive and a
 numerous legislature they have with great propriety considered
 energy as the most necessary qualification of the former and have
 constitutions of several of the states new york and new jersey if
 i recollect right are the only states which have intrusted the
 executive authority wholly to single men both these methods
 of destroying the unity of the executive have their partisans but
 division of the government between them the patricians engaged in
 a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of
 their ancient authorities and dignities the consuls who were
 generally chosen out of the former body were commonly united by the
 clothed with equal dignity and authority there is peculiar danger
 of personal emulation and even animosity from either and
 especially from all these causes the most bitter dissensions are
 apt to spring whenever these happen they lessen the
 opportunities of remarking with horror to what desperate lengths
 this disposition is sometimes carried and how often the great
 interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity to the conceit
 and to the obstinacy of individuals who have credit enough to make
 dissension in the executive department here they are pure and
 unmixed there is no point at which they cease to operate they
 serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure
 to which they relate from the first step to the final conclusion of
 habitual feebleness and dilatoriness
but one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the
 executive and which lies as much against the last as the first
 plan is that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility 
 account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable
i was overruled by my council the council were so divided in
 their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better
 resolution on the point these and similar pretexts are
 interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so
 manifestly improper in tenderness to individuals i forbear to
 descend to particulars
it is evident from these considerations that the plurality of
 inadmissible in a free government but even there the king is not
 bound by the resolutions of his council though they are answerable
 for the advice they give he is the absolute master of his own
 conduct in the exercise of his office and may observe or disregard
 disadvantages on the opposite side but i do not think the rule at
 all applicable to the executive power i clearly concur in opinion
 in this particular with a writer whom the celebrated junius
 pronounces to be deep solid and ingenious that the
 more readily suspected and who cannot unite so great a mass of
 influence as when he is associated with others the decemvirs of
 rome whose name denotes their number were more to be dreaded

 same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles
 energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of
 good government it is essential to the protection of the community
 theory must be in practice a bad government
taking it for granted therefore that all men of sense will
 agree in the necessity of an energetic executive it will only
 remain to inquire what are the ingredients which constitute this
 adapted to deliberation and wisdom and best calculated to
 conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their
 privileges and interests
that unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed
 most lights be examined in conjunction
the experience of other nations will afford little instruction
 on this head as far however as it teaches any thing it teaches
 us not to be enamoured of plurality in the executive we have seen
 republic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire it
 became an established custom with the consuls to divide the
 administration between themselves by lot one of them remaining at
 rome to govern the city and its environs the other taking the
 assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country consisting of
 a plurality of persons they might impede or frustrate the most
 important measures of the government in the most critical
 emergencies of the state and what is still worse they might split
 melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty or
 rather detestable vice in the human character
upon the principles of a free government inconveniences from
 the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the
 and expedition and this without anycounterbalancing good in the
 conduct of war in which the energy of the executive is the bulwark
 of the national security every thing would be to be apprehended
 from its plurality
 office man in public trust will much oftener act in such a
 manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted than
 in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment but
 the multiplication of the executive adds to the difficulty of
 scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction should there
 be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task
 if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned how
 easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity as to
 power first the restraints of public opinion which lose their
 efficacy as well on account of the division of the censure
 attendant on bad measures among a number as on account of the
 uncertainty on whom it ought to fall and secondly the
 responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the
 british constitution dictates the propriety of a council not only
 ceases to apply but turns against the institution in the monarchy
 of great britain it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited
 and watchfulness of the people and in a word that all
 multiplication of the executive is rather dangerous than friendly to
 liberty
a little consideration will satisfy us that the species of
 council the extreme of these numbers is not too great for an easy
 combination and from such a combination america would have more to
 fear than from the ambition of any single individual a council to
 a magistrate who is himself responsible for what he does are

 resolutions do not bind him

 more for the sake of the one than for the sake of the other this
 remark is not less applicable to a political privilege or honor or
 such men entertain very crude notions as well of the purposes for
 which government was instituted as of the true means by which the
 public happiness may be promoted the republican principle demands
 that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct
 interests to withstand the temporary delusion in order to give
 them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection
 instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved
 the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes and
 the legislative such a separation must be merely nominal and
 incapable of producing the ends for which it was established it is
 one thing to be subordinate to the laws and another to be dependent
 on the legislative body the first comports with the last

 legislature unless the one were possessed of the power of
 appointing or displacing the other one answer to this inquiry may
 be drawn from the principle already remarked that is from the

 but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a
 material influence upon the spirit and character of the government

 office of the nation it would necessitate a mutability of measures
 it is not generally to be expected that men will vary and measures

 object beyond his present station to which he may sacrifice his
 independence may he have no connections no friends for whom he
 may sacrifice it may he not be less willing by a firm conduct to
 make personal enemies when he acts under the impression that a time
 people seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite might
 occasion greater danger to liberty than could ever reasonably be
 dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office by the
 voluntary suffrages of the community exercising a constitutional
 merely nominal and nugatory the legislature with a discretionary
 power over the salary and emoluments of the chief magistrate could
 render him as obsequious to their will as they might think proper to
 make him they might in most cases either reduce him by famine
 states or any of them it is impossible to imagine any provision
 which would have been more eligible than this the legislature on
 the appointment of a president is once for all to declare what
 shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which

 preventing their becoming laws unless they should afterwards be
 ratified by two thirds of each of the component members of the
 legislative body

 other but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of
 selfdefense
but the power in question has a further use it not only serves
 encroach upon the rights of other members of the government that a
 spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations that
 impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which
 itself on maturer reflexion would condemn the primary inducement
 blemish in the character and genius of our governments they will
 consider every institution calculated to restrain the excess of
 lawmaking and to keep things in the same state in which they
 happen to be at any given period as much more likely to do good
 displeasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of the
 legislative body nor is it probable that he would ultimately
 venture to exert his prerogatives but in a case of manifest
 propriety or extreme necessity all wellinformed men in that
 of the executive or in a case in which the public good was
 evidently and palpably sacrificed a man of tolerable firmness would
 avail himself of his constitutional means of defense and would
 listen to the admonitions of duty and responsibility in the former
 scruple to return it for reconsideration subject to being finally
 rejected only in the event of more than one third of each house
 concurring in the sufficiency of his objections he would be
 encouraged by the reflection that if his opposition should prevail
 unjustifiable pursuits are aware that obstructions may come from a
 quarter which they cannot control they will often be restrained by
 the bare apprehension of opposition from doing what they would with
 eagerness rush into if no such external impediments were to be
 combination might by degrees be cemented between the executive and
 judiciary departments it is impossible to keep the judges too
 distinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws 
 it is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be

 concentrated the military authority in him alone of all the cares
 or concerns of government the direction of war most peculiarly

 objection forbids a precise answer in what manner is this

first as to the mode of appointing the judges this is
 the same with that of appointing the officers of the union in

 body and it is the best expedient which can be devised in any
 government to secure a steady upright and impartial
 administration of the laws

 it can never attack with success either of the other two and that
 all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against
 their attacks it equally proves that though individual oppression

the complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly
 essential in a limited constitution by a limited constitution i
 understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the
 that every act of a delegated authority contrary to the tenor of
 the commission under which it is exercised is void no legislative
 act therefore contrary to the constitution can be valid to deny
 this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his
 fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law it
 therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning as well as the
 meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body
 if there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the
 it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning
 and operation so far as they can by any fair construction be
 reconciled to each other reason and law conspire to dictate that
 this should be done where this is impracticable it becomes a
 particular statute contravenes the constitution it will be the duty
 of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the
 former

 those ill humors which the arts of designing men or the influence
 of particular conjunctures sometimes disseminate among the people

 themselves collectively as well as individually and no

 their representatives in a departure from it prior to such an act

 relate to the intercourse between the united states and foreign
 nations or to that between the states themselves th to all
 those which originate on the high seas and are of admiralty or
 maritime jurisdiction and lastly to all those in which the state
 appears to have been thought by the convention preferable to the
 former and i presume will be most agreeable to the states
as to the second point it is impossible by any argument or
 comment to make it clearer than it is in itself if there are such
 as in any other manner is with reason classed among the just causes
 of war it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have
 cognizance of all causes in which the citizens of other countries
 are concerned this is not less essential to the preservation of
the power of determining causes between two states between one
 state and the citizens of another and between the citizens of
 different states is perhaps not less essential to the peace of the
 union than that which has been just examined history gives us a
 constitution establishes particular guards against the repetition of
 those instances which have heretofore made their appearance yet it
 is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which produced them will
 assume new shapes that could not be foreseen nor specifically
 union will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the
 principles on which it is founded
the fifth point will demand little animadversion the most
 bigoted idolizers of state authority have not thus far shown a
 could be expected to be unbiased the laws may have even prejudged
 the question and tied the courts down to decisions in favor of the
 grants of the state to which they belonged and even where this had
 not been done it would be natural that the judges as men should
 then to extend
first to all cases in law and equity arising under the
 constitution and the laws of the united states this corresponds
 with the two first classes of causes which have been enumerated as
 object of equitable rather than of legal jurisdiction as the
 distinction is known and established in several of the states it
 is the peculiar province for instance of a court of equity to
 relieve against what are called hard bargains these are contracts
 the fourth class of the enumerated cases as they have an evident
 connection with the preservation of the national peace
third to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction
 these form altogether the fifth of the enumerated classes of
from this review of the particular powers of the federal
 judiciary as marked out in the constitution it appears that they
 are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed
 the structure of that department and which were necessary to the
 between different courts and their relations to each other
 the judicial power of the united states is by the plan of
 the convention to be vested in one supreme court and in such
 inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and
 power of construing the laws according to the spirit of the
 constitution will enable that court to mould them into whatever
 shape it may think proper especially as its decisions will not be
 in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the
 and that wherever there is an evident opposition the laws ought to
 give place to the constitution but this doctrine is not deducible
 from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention but
 from the general theory of a limited constitution and as far as it
 nearly upon it as on this account alone to be less eligible than
 the mode preferred by the convention from a body which had even a
 partial agency in passing bad laws we could rarely expect a
 disposition to temper and moderate them in the application the
 ill consequences of defective information so on account of the
 natural propensity of such bodies to party divisions there will be
 no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may
 poison the fountains of justice the habit of being continually
 constitutions authorizes the revisal of a judicial sentence by a
 legislative act nor is there any thing in the proposed
 constitution more than in either of them by which it is forbidden
 in the former as well as in the latter the impropriety of the
 comparative weakness and from its total incapacity to support its
 usurpations by force and the inference is greatly fortified by the
 consideration of the important constitutional check which the power
 of instituting impeachments in one part of the legislative body and
 supreme court in every case of federal cognizance it is intended
 to enable the national government to institute or authoruze in each
 state or district of the united states a tribunal competent to the
 determination of matters of national jurisdiction within its limits
 states would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the
 union state judges holding their offices during pleasure or from
 year to year will be too little independent to be relied upon for
 an inflexible execution of the national laws and if there was a
 safely circumscribed within a narrow compass this plan appears to
 me at present the most eligible of any that could be adopted and
 in order to it it is necessary that the power of constituting
 inferior courts should exist in the full extent in which it is to be
 to them in cases in which a state might happen to be a party it
 would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal
 though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject
 of this paper i shall take occasion to mention here a supposition
 color to pretend that the state governments would by the adoption
 of that plan be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts
 in their own way free from every constraint but that which flows
 from the obligations of good faith the contracts between a nation
the propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely
 called in question in regard to matters of law but the clamors
 have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact some
 wellintentioned men in this state deriving their notions from the
 legislative provision in a new government it must depend on the
 latter and may be with or without the aid of a jury as may be
 judged advisable if therefore the reexamination of a fact once
 determined by a jury should in any case be admitted under the
 judgment i contend therefore on this ground that the
 expressions appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact do
 not necessarily imply a reexamination in the supreme court of facts
 decided by juries in the inferior courts
 will be safest to declare generally that the supreme court shall
 possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact and that
 this jurisdiction shall be subject to such exceptions and
 regulations as the national legislature may prescribe this will
 been preserved to the supreme court and the rest consigned to the
 subordinate tribunals that the supreme court will possess an
 appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact in all the cases
 referred to them both subject to any exceptions and regulations
 speaking and pronouncing of the law
 i hold that the states will have concurrent jurisdiction with
 the subordinate federal judicatories in many cases of federal
 cognizance as will be explained in my next paper
 federal jurisdiction is this to be exclusive or are those courts
 to possess a concurrent jurisdiction if the latter in what
 relation will they stand to the national tribunals these are
 inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense and
 appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the
 federal courts is contained in this passage  the judicial power
 of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in
 such inferior courts as the congress shall from time to time ordain
 be established for not to allow the state courts a right of
 jurisdiction in such cases can hardly be considered as the
 abridgment of a preexisting authority i mean not therefore to
 contend that the united states in the course of legislation upon
 they truly are in the light of kindred systems and as parts of one
 whole the inference seems to be conclusive that the state courts
 would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the
 laws of the union where it was not expressly prohibited
 the most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government
 and would essentially embarrass its measures nor do i perceive any
 foundation for such a supposition agreeably to the remark already
 made the national and state systems are to be regarded as one whole 
 of the convention in the first place authorizes the national
 legislature to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme
 court it declares in the next place that the judicial
 power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and
 most cases in which they may be deemed proper instead of being
 carried to the supreme court may be made to lie from the state
 courts to district courts of the union

 that this pretended abolition is complete and universal extending
 not only to every species of civil but even to criminal causes to
 argue with respect to the latter would however be as vain and
 fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the existence of
the rules of legal interpretation are rules of commonsense
 adopted by the courts in the construction of the laws the true
 test therefore of a just application of them is its conformity to
 the source from which they are derived this being the case let me
 this head the specification of an obligation to try all criminal
 causes in a particular mode excludes indeed the obligation or
 necessity of employing the same mode in civil causes but does not
 abridge the power of the legislature to exercise that mode if it
 convention declares that the power of congress or in other words
 of the national legislature shall extend to certain enumerated
 cases this specification of particulars evidently excludes all
 pretension to a general legislative authority because an
 her property by deed executed in the presence of a magistrate in
 such a case there can be no doubt but the specification would amount
 to an exclusion of any other mode of conveyance because the woman
 having no previous power to alienate her property the specification
 situation in which it is placed by the state constitutions and will
 be in no degree altered or influenced by the adoption of the plan
 under consideration the foundation of this assertion is that the
 national judiciary will have no cognizance of them and of course
 to liberty the latter represent it as the very palladium of free
 government for my own part the more the operation of the
 institution has fallen under my observation the more reason i have
 discovered for holding it in high estimation and it would be
it has been observed that trial by jury is a safeguard against
 an oppressive exercise of the power of taxation this observation
 deserves to be canvassed
it is evident that it can have no influence upon the
 the security aimed at wilful abuses of a public authority to the
 oppression of the subject and every species of official extortion
 are offenses against the government for which the persons who
 commit them may be indicted and punished according to the
 difficulty in gaining some of the jurors promiscuously taken from
 the public mass than in gaining men who had been chosen by the
 government for their probity and good character but making every
 deduction for these considerations the trial by jury must still be
 method of determining questions of property and that on this
 account alone it would be entitled to a constitutional provision in
 its favor if it were possible to fix the limits within which it
 ought to be comprehended there is however in all cases great
 trial by jury prevails and this with some exceptions in all the
 others a single judge presides and proceeds in general either
 according to the course of the canon or civil law without the aid
 of a jury in new jersey there is a court of chancery which
 is called a special jury and for which a particular mode of
 appointment is marked out in connecticut they have no distinct
 courts either of chancery or of admiralty and their courts of
 probates have no jurisdiction of causes their commonlaw courts
 could have been fixed upon by the convention which would have
 corresponded with the circumstances of all the states and
 secondly that more or at least as much might have been hazarded by
 taking the system of any one state for a standard as by omitting a
as on the one hand the form of the provision would not fulfil
 the intent of its proposers so on the other if i apprehend that
 intent rightly it would be in itself inexpedient i presume it to
 be that causes in the federal courts should be tried by jury if
 they will sometimes be under the influence of impressions which will
 not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those considerations of
 public policy which ought to guide their inquiries there would of
 course be always danger that the rights of other nations might be
my convictions are equally strong that great advantages result
 from the separation of the equity from the law jurisdiction and
 that the causes which belong to the former would be improperly
 committed to juries the great and primary use of a court of equity
 particulars
it is true that the separation of the equity from the legal
 jurisdiction is peculiar to the english system of jurisprudence
 which is the model that has been followed in several of the states
 supposed defect
it is in this form in civil actions between citizens of
 different states every issue of fact arising in actions at common
 law may be tried by a jury if the parties or either of them
 actions of equitable jurisdiction are ascertained in conformity to
 the rules which prevail in england upon that subject in many of
 the other states the boundaries are less precise in some of them
 every cause is to be tried in a court of common law and upon that
 would be acceptable to all the states in the union or that would
 perfectly quadrate with the several state institutions
it may be asked why could not a reference have been made to the
 constitution of this state taking that which is allowed by me to
 have been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local
 prejudices against it which perhaps might have hazarded in no
 inconsiderable degree its final establishment
to avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which
 tended to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned
 only in the trial by jury in criminal cases which is provided for
 in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention that even
 in far the greatest proportion of civil cases and those in which
 all cases the examples of innovations which contract its ancient
 limits as well in these states as in great britain afford a strong
 presumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient and
 give room to suppose that future experience may discover the
 provisions though not altogether useless have far less virtue and
 efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them and the want of them
 will never be with men of sound discernment a decisive objection
 to any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good
 circumstances which form exceptions to general rules
 vide no  in which the supposition of its being
 abolished by the appellate jurisdiction in matters of fact being
 vested in the supreme court is examined and refuted
 that the constitutions of several of the states are in a similar
 predicament i add that new york is of the number and yet the
 opposers of the new system in this state who profess an unlimited
 admiration for its constitution are among the most intemperate
 indictment trial judgment and punishment according to law
 section  of the same article clause  the privilege of the
 writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in
 cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it
 treason but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of
 blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted
 it may well be a question whether these are not upon the
 whole of equal importance with any which are to be found in the
 engine of arbitrary government and as a remedy for this fatal
 evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the
 habeascorpus act which in one place he calls the bulwark of
 the british constitution
 are in their origin stipulations between kings and their subjects
 abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege reservations of
 rights not surrendered to the prince such was magna charta
 obtained by the barons sword in hand from king john such were

but a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less
 applicable to a constitution like that under consideration which is
 merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the
 regulating power but it is evident that it would furnish to men
 disposed to usurp a plausible pretense for claiming that power
 they might urge with a semblance of reason that the constitution
 ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the
 be inserted in any constitution respecting it must altogether
 depend on public opinion and on the general spirit of the people
 and of the government and here after all as is intimated
 upon another occasion must we seek for the only solid basis of all
 adverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights
 it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the
 convention it may be said that it does not go far enough though
 it will not be easy to make this appear but it can with no
 safely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite
 control but there are satisfactory reasons to show that the
 objection is in reality not well founded there is in most of the
 arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the
 governments the executive and legislative bodies of each state
 will be so many sentinels over the persons employed in every
 department of the national administration and as it will be in
 their power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of
 union
among the many curious objections which have appeared against
 the proposed constitution the most extraordinary and the least
 colorable is derived from the want of some provision respecting the
 convinced that union is the basis of their political happiness
 men of sense of all parties now with few exceptions agree that it
 cannot be preserved under the present system nor without radical
 alterations that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to
it is evident that the principal departments of the
 administration under the present government are the same which will
 be required under the new there are now a secretary of war a
 secretary of foreign affairs a secretary for domestic affairs a
 either the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than
 those of the former
where then are we to seek for those additional articles of
 expense which are to swell the account to the enormous size that has
 suffice for the session of both the senate and the house of
 representatives we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a
 third or perhaps half for the former the extra business of
 treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the
 period by above a fourth or fifth of that number the congress
 under the proposed government will do all the business of the united
 states themselves without the intervention of the state
 legislatures who thenceforth will have only to attend to the

 what logic it could be maintained that the declarations in the

 have been noted in the course of our inquiries are as much
 chargeable on the existing constitution of this state as on the one

 concurrence of thirteen states if on the contrary the

 would be a single proposition and might be brought forward singly
 there would then be no necessity for management or compromise in

 ordinary degree of public spirit and integrity will in my opinion
 constantly impose on the national rulers the necessity of a spirit
 of accommodation to the reasonable expectations of their

 erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority
