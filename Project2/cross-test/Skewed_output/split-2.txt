 subsisting federal government you are called upon to deliberate on
 a new constitution for the united states of america the subject
 public good but this is a thing more ardently to be wished than
 seriously to be expected the plan offered to our deliberations
 may be actuated by upright intentions and it cannot be doubted
 that much of the opposition which has made its appearance or may

 cured by persecution

 judgment their interest can never be separated and that a

 experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine

 them except prussia are maritime and therefore able to annoy and
 the judicial decisions of the national government will be more wise
 systematical and judicious than those of individual states and
 with britain adds great weight to this reasoning

 states than of the union not a single indian war has yet been
 occasioned by aggressions of the present federal government feeble

 carrying on the wars in which that country has been engaged and in
 which are an excrescence of the late war but this cannot happen

 trader and eventually to the revenue itself they tend to render
 other classes of the community tributary in an improper degree to

are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people

both will depend will be more on the side of the state

of this mass of power among its constituent parts one of the
tendency to such an accumulation no further arguments would be
necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system i

of elementary truths the several characteristic principles of

accordingly mixes these departments in several respects the

the entire departments from exercising the powers of another

nevertheless to the executive magistrate a partial control over

i will hazard a few general observations which may perhaps place
department in particular it might be inexpedient to insist
rigorously on the principle first because peculiar
a reflection on human nature that such devices should be
necessary to control the abuses of government but what is
possible to give to each department an equal power of

detached from the rights of its own department if the principles

against the injustice of the other part different interests

the security for civil rights must be the same as that for
the weaker anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state
of nature where the weaker individual is not secured against the

former by introducing into the government a will not dependent
elected those of the former are to be the same with those of the
electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures
alterable by the state governments and it cannot be feared that
the people of the states will alter this part of their
or useful first as it is essential to liberty that the
government in general should have a common interest with the
anterior to the date of magna charta is too obscure to yield
instruction the very existence of it has been made a question
in the present century under on alarm for the hanoverian
succession from these facts it appears that the greatest
chance of some event which might produce a general new election
the ability also of the irish parliament to maintain the rights
reason to infer from the spirit and conduct of the
representatives of the people prior to the revolution that
in no danger from biennial elections the conclusion resulting
from these examples will be not a little strengthened by
of the government above cited with less power therefore to
abuse the federal representatives can be less tempted on one
for all the variations which may be required by the various
situations and circumstances of civil society the election of
wholly inapplicable to our case the important distinction so
well understood in america between a constitution established by
practices has produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of
free government of which frequency of elections is the
people of america will not be more secure under biennial
elections unalterably fixed by such a constitution than those
put into this simple form does the period of two years bear no
greater proportion to the knowledge requisite for federal
properly regulated by uniform laws without some acquaintance
with the commerce the ports the usages and the regulatious of
new members the affairs of the union will become more and more
objects of curiosity and conversation among the citizens at
affairs those particular branches will frequently deserve
attention in the ordinary course of legislation and will
of long standing will be thoroughly masters of the public
business and perhaps not unwilling to avail themselves of those
experience for simplifying and accelerating the process in
disputed cases so great a portion of a year would unavoidably
establishment of the same rule for the appointment of taxes will
probably be as little contested though the rule itself in this
full force i shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning
which may be offered on the opposite side we subscribe to the
member of the society not as a part of the irrational creation
as a moral person not as a mere article of property the
in a system which considered their slaves in some degree as men
when burdens were to be imposed but refused to consider them in
right of choosing this allotted number in each state is to be
exercised by such part of the inhabitants as the state itself may
which regards them as inhabitants but as debased by servitude
below the equal level of free inhabitants which regards the
comparative wealth of the states states have not like
individuals an influence over each other arising from superior
federal resolutions depends on the subsequent and voluntary
resolutions of the states composing the union hence the states
representation which the convention have established in one
respect the establishment of a common measure for representation
this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated
scarce any article indeed in the whole constitution seems to be
directly with each other or consider the proportions which they
respectively bear to the number of their constituents passing
numerous as where they are very few were the representatives in
virginia to be regulated by the standard in rhode island they
assembly would still have been a mob                            
                                          it is necessary also to
one for every thirty thousand raise the number of
representatives to at least one hundred estimating the negroes
i have received with regard to the present genius of the people
of america the spirit which actuates the state legislatures and
circumstances now before us and from the probable state of them
within a moderate period of time i must pronounce that the
means than force would not have been scrupled yet we know by
happy experience that the public trust was not betrayed nor has
fortunately the constitution has provided a still further
safeguard the members of the congress are rendered ineligible
for selfgovernment and that nothing less than the chains of
despotism can restrain them from destroying and devouring one
no further than to those circumstances and interests to which the
authority and care of the representative relate an ignorance of
few intelligent men diffusively elected within the state divide
the largest state into ten or twelve districts and it will be
legislation is it not evident that a degree of local information
and preparatory labor would be found in the several volumes of
extensive information which the representatives ought to possess
and the time that might be necessary for acquiring it this
situation of the different states will have an assimilating
effect the effect of time on the internal affairs of the states
and twentythree persons  it cannot be supposed that the half
thus elected and who do not even reside among the people at
every object of legislation within a nation whose affairs are in
the highest degree diversified and complicated yet it is very
sympathy with the mass of the people and be most likely to aim
at an ambitious sacrifice of the many to the aggrandizement of
on the contrary strictly conformable to these principles and
scrupulously impartial to the rights and pretensions of every
also by those qualities which entitle them to it and which
promise a sincere and scrupulous regard to the nature of their
preservation of the favor than from innovations in the
government subversive of the authority of the people all these
examples but without which every government degenerates into
tyranny if it be asked what is to restrain the house of
important ends what then are we to understand by the objection
which this paper has combated what are we to say to the men who
pretended that this difference is sufficient to justify an
attachment to the state governments and an abhorrence to the
inhabitants besides a variety of powerful causes not existing
here and which favor in that country the pretensions of rank and
counties of new york and albany are elected by very nearly as
many voters as will be entitled to a representative in the
consideration has it appeared on trial that the senators of new
hampshire massachusetts and new york or the executive council
the remaining charge against the house of representatives which
i am to examine is grounded on a supposition that the number of
limitation that the whole number shall not exceed one for every
thirty thousand inhabitants if we review the constitutions of
in which their influence predominates and it so happens that
four only of the largest will have a majority of the whole votes
except the originating of money bills it cannot be doubted that
the house composed of the greater number of members when
length of time advance in population with peculiar rapidity
they will be interested in frequent reapportionments of the
its activity and importance and finally reducing as far as it
seems to have wished all the overgrown prerogatives of the other
the continual triumph of the british house of commons over the
other branches of the government whenever the engine of a money

will in fact direct their proceedings in the first place the

to regret a departure from so fundamental a principle as a
portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of
power of regulating elections for the national government in the
hands of the state legislatures would leave the existence of the
states would any man have hesitated to condemn it both as an
unwarrantable transposition of power and as a premeditated
complete security against an abuse of the trust this argument
though specious will not upon examination be found solid it
greater good no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an
accumulation of the evil where no necessity urges nor any
general government to the advancement of their happiness in which
event no good citizen could desire its continuance but with
and supported by a strong faction in each of those states may be
in a very opposite temper this diversity of sentiment between a

seldom fail to be patronized and abetted by some of them its
 any state from its share in the representation the interest of all
 would in this respect at least be the security of all but it is
 majority but that so fundamental a privilege in a country so
 situated and enlightened should be invaded to the prejudice of the
 will be the dissimilar modes of constituting the several component
 parts of the government the house of representatives being to be
 the voluntary cooperation of the state legislatures if we make
 the latter supposition it then becomes immaterial where the power
 inference will be that a conduct tending to give an undue
 preference to either is much less to be dreaded from the former than
 of this branch of the federal legislature in applying thus
 particularly to the senate a general observation suggested by the
 constitution in favor of the landed class because that class would
 in the natural course of things enjoy as great a preponderancy as

 depriving the people at large of the opportunity of exercising their

if it should be said that defects in the state constitutions
 convince us that it is less probable that a predominant faction in a
 single state should in order to maintain its superiority incline
 the several states as they are now established for local purposes
 vary between extremes as wide as march and november the
 admirers of the constitution of the state the question may be
 retorted and it may be asked why was not a time for the like
 seemed to merit notice i enter next on the examination of the
 senate
 appears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of
 adopted citizens whose merits and talents may claim a share in the
 independent and sovereign states bound together by a simple league
 the parties however unequal in size ought to have an equal share
in this spirit it may be remarked that the equal vote allowed
 to each state is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion
 lawmaking seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most
 liable it is not impossible that this part of the constitution may
 precaution founded on such clear principles and now so well
 understood in the united states that it would be more than
 a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of
 legislation it is not possible that an assembly of men called for
 attained some governments are deficient in both these qualities
 most governments are deficient in the first i scruple not to
 other nations and all the advantages connected with national
 character an individual who is observed to be inconstant to his
 calamitous it poisons the blessing of liberty itself it will be
 of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of
 every useful undertaking the success and profit of which may depend
 on a continuance of existing arrangements what prudent merchant

 every instance been previously tried by the light in which they
 that frequency of elections which in other cases produces this
 responsibility this remark will perhaps appear not only new but
 nor is it possible for the people to estimate the share of
 influence which their annual assemblies may respectively have on
 stimulated by some irregular passion or some illicit advantage or
 misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men may call
 the use of auxiliary precautions it may even be remarked that the
 same extended situation which will exempt the people of america
 stability with liberty i am not unaware of the circumstances which
 distinguish the american from other popular governments as well
 the use which has been made of this difference in reasonings
 contained in former papers will have shown that i am disposed

 also whatever might be its power or the duration of its
 administration of the former the distinction however thus
 qualified must be admitted to leave a most advantageous superiority
before such a revolution can be effected the senate it is to
 be observed must in the first place corrupt itself must next

 naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than

i proceed now to trace the real characters of the proposed
 consider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a
 dangerous influence in a single state than for establishing a like
 if upon that reconsideration it be approved by two thirds of both
 houses the king of great britain on his part has an absolute

 have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the
 authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of great
 britain but in substance much inferior to it it would amount to
 government which have not been matured into actual treason may be
 screened from punishment of every kind by the interposition of the
 adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort and that
 by the laws of new york it is confined within similar bounds
 that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most
 complete legal validity and perfection independent of any other
 delicate and important prerogative
the president is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors
 of new york if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution
 of the state by the practice which has obtained under it the power
 of this state in the disposition of offices must in practice be
 greatly superior to that of the chief magistrate of the union

 is the sole possessor of the power of making treaties the one

 the absolute power of a single man under the formidable title of

the ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense
 power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority or
 by vesting it ostensibly in one man subject in whole or in part
 magistrates that the dissensions between them were not more
 frequent or more fatal is a matter of astonishment until we advert
 discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of
 plurality in the executive under any modification whatever
 disapprove opposition then becomes in their estimation an
 indispensable duty of selflove they seem to think themselves
 obstruct salutary plans yet often promote deliberation and
 circumspection and serve to check excesses in the majority when a
 necessary to the operations of the ostensible executive an artful
 cabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the
 circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or
 misfortune are sometimes so complicated that where there are a

 the impropriety of the thing when inquiry has been made the blame

 nothing therefore can be wiser in that kingdom than to annex to

 maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the

there is an idea which is not without its advocates that a
 conquest and destruction of rome
there can be no need however to multiply arguments or examples
 of their views have declared in favor of a single executive and a
 numerous legislature they have with great propriety considered
 i recollect right are the only states which have intrusted the
 executive authority wholly to single men both these methods
 a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of
 their ancient authorities and dignities the consuls who were
 of personal emulation and even animosity from either and
 especially from all these causes the most bitter dissensions are
 this disposition is sometimes carried and how often the great
 interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity to the conceit
 unmixed there is no point at which they cease to operate they
 serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure
but one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the
 executive and which lies as much against the last as the first
i was overruled by my council the council were so divided in
 their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better
 manifestly improper in tenderness to individuals i forbear to
 descend to particulars
 bound by the resolutions of his council though they are answerable
 for the advice they give he is the absolute master of his own
 all applicable to the executive power i clearly concur in opinion
 in this particular with a writer whom the celebrated junius
 influence as when he is associated with others the decemvirs of
 rome whose name denotes their number were more to be dreaded
 unity of the executive of this state was one of the best of the
 distinguishing features of our constitution
 the longer the duration in office the greater will be the
 probability of obtaining so important an advantage it is a general
 fortitude in either case feebleness and irresolution must be the
 characteristics of the station
 artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve
 it and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it
 the various branches of power teaches us likewise that this
 partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent
 other departments and as they commonly have the people on their
 side they always act with such momentum as to make it very
 against ambitious designs would not for that reason be preferable
 to a longer period which was at the same time too short for the
 his constituents he might then hazard with safety in proportion
 to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity and to the
 might be unequal to the task which the constitution assigns him i
 shall only add that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of
 preparatory plans of finance the application and disbursement of
 the public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the
 considerations and the influence of personal confidences and
 attachments would be likely to induce every new president to
 nearly the same effects and these effects would be for the most
 part rather pernicious than salutary
 the generality of men in such a situation is the negative merit of
 not doing harm instead of the positive merit of doing good
an ambitious man too when he found himself seated on the
 summit of his countrys honors when he looked forward to the time
 of a nation can it be wise to put this desirable and essential
 quality under the ban of the constitution and to declare that the
 be detrimental to the community inasmuch as it would substitute
 inexperience to experience and would tend to unhinge and set afloat
what are the advantages promised to counterbalance these
 disadvantages they are represented to be st greater
 adroit enough to conciliate the goodwill of the people he might
 induce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint

the third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the
 constitution it is there provided that the president of the
 united states shall at stated times receive for his services a

 annihilated by a single vote and in the one mode or the other the
 legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended
but this observation when examined will appear rather specious
 than solid the propriety of the thing does not turn upon the

 includes that of preventing good ones and may be used to the one
 hesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions of the two
 houses of parliament he would not fail to exert the utmost
 drawn from this very source it has been represented on this
 account as a power odious in appearance useless in practice but
 on the sense of a considerable part of the legislative body
 instead of an absolute negative it is proposed to give the
 counterposing weight of the executive it is at any rate far less
 probable that this should be the case than that such views should
 that the judges who are to be the interpreters of the law might
 receive an improper bias from having given a previous opinion in
 of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the
 several states when called into the actual service of the united
 impeachment humanity and good policy conspire to dictate that
 the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible
the expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the
 president has if i mistake not been only contested in relation to
 given birth to the offense and when parties were pretty equally
 matched the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the
 whether in a limited constitution that power could be delegated by
 law and in the second place that it would generally be impolitic
 others that it ought to have been exclusively deposited in the
 senate another source of objection is derived from the small
 that power in the class of executive authorities yet this is
 evidently an arbitrary disposition for if we attend carefully to
 in those transactions while the vast importance of the trust and
 the operation of treaties as laws plead strongly for the
 foreign power the price of his treachery to his constituents the
 history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of
 cooperation of the executive though it would be imprudent to
 confide in him solely so important a trust yet it cannot be doubted
 character decision secrecy and despatch are incompatible with
 the genius of a body so variable and so numerous the very

 the major sense of the community if two thirds of the whole number

 objections to reposing the power in question in a body of men

 resolutions of a collective body there is nothing so apt to
the truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been
 felt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault with the

 magistrate it is not likely that their sanction would often be

 doubted that the charge is to a considerable extent well founded
 but it is as little to be doubted that there is always a large

 satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it a new president would

 single advantage to be looked for from the uncontrolled agency of
the reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment
 in this state the council of appointment consists of from three to

 the ascendant he must necessarily have in this delicate and

 to compose the council this would involve the mischiefs of a

 that in half a century it may consist of three or four hundred

 least we can readily discover a good reason for it as this body

 not the only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in
 extent to these points therefore our observations shall be
 confined
 their imaginations and judgments the standard of good behavior for
 the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy is certainly
 neither force nor will but merely judgment and must ultimately
 depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of
 of being overpowered awed or influenced by its coordinate
 branches and that as nothing can contribute so much to its
 necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void
 as this doctrine is of great importance in all the american
 is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be
 an intermediate body between the people and the legislature in
this exercise of judicial discretion in determining between two
 contradictory laws is exemplified in a familiar instance it not
 subordinate authority of an original and derivative power the
 nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as
 the permanent tenure of judicial offices since nothing will
 contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges
 of those provisions or that the courts would be under a greater
 obligation to connive at infractions in this shape than when they
 operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them who
 perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are
 expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary
 commission periodical appointments however regulated or by
 folly and wickedness of mankind that the records of those
 precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk and
 convention acted wisely in copying from the models of those
 constitutions which have established good behavior as the tenure of
 the remark made in relation to the president is equally applicable
 here in the general course of human nature a power over a mans
 state of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the
 constitution inadmissible what might be extravagant today might

 be secured in their places for life it may well happen especially

the arguments or rather suggestions upon which this charge is

 construe the laws according to the spirit of the constitution or

 agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of
 laborious study to the revision and control of men who for want of

 proceed to consider the propriety of the power of constituting
 inferior courts and the relations which will subsist between
 there are in my opinion substantial reasons against such a
 provision the most discerning cannot foresee how far the
 dozen districts and to institute a federal court in each district
 in lieu of one in every state the judges of these courts with the
 represent it is both expedient and proper that such questions
 should be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory
 it will remain with the states and the danger intimated must be
 merely ideal the circumstances which are necessary to produce an
 two classes of causes and those of a nature rarely to occur in
 all other cases of federal cognizance the original jurisdiction
 impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the
 jurisprudence of any particular state the expression taken in the
 of both fact and law nor is it even possible to separate them
 though the commonlaw courts of this state ascertain disputed facts
 an express exception of cases which shall have been originally tried
 by a jury because in the courts of some of the states all causes
the amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of
 the judicial department is this that it has been carefully
 court and the evident design of the provision is to enable the
 institution of local courts subordinate to the supreme either in
 can adjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistent whole
such questions accordingly have arisen upon the plan proposed
 with respect to the former as well as the latter and under this
 impression i shall lay it down as a rule that the state courts
 natural and the most defensible construction
but this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly
 between parties within its jurisdiction though the causes of
 dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the
 be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national
 concern else the judiciary authority of the union may be eluded at
 interpretation
but could an appeal be made to lie from the state courts to the
 advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined it
 would diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal courts
 to and exposed but continues to be pursued in all the conversations
 and writings of the opponents of the plan the mere silence of the
 specification of particulars is an exclusion of generals or
 the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another hence
 the subject of juries the legislature would be at liberty either to
 adopt that institution or to let it alone this discretion in
 natural and obvious sense of its provisions apart from any
 technical rules is the true criterion of construction
 i shall add one case more to demonstrate the proper use of these
 maxims and the abuse which has been made of them
from these observations it must appear unquestionably true that
 trial by jury is in no case abolished by the proposed constitution
 extent by the proposed alteration in our system of government
the friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention if
 be the great engines of judicial despotism and these have all
 relation to criminal proceedings the trial by jury in criminal
 promote the convenience of the citizens it would often occasion an
 accumulation of costs more burdensome than the original sum of the
 accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges who are a
 collective body it is not difficult to see that it would be in
 might be if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all
 causes
 is necessary in this state our judicial establishments resemble
 more nearly than in any other those of great britain we have
 bears most affinity to pennsylvania south carolina to virginia i
 believe however that in some of those states which have distinct
 side
from this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity
 altogether unknown because the present federal government has no
 judiciary power whatever and consequently there is no proper
 particularly in cases which concern the public peace with foreign
 nations that is in most cases where the question turns wholly on
 impolicy of inserting a fundamental provision in the constitution
 which would make the state systems a standard for the national
 were permitted to return to them the simplicity and expedition
 which form the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial
these appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating
 the systems of all the states in the formation of the national
 union and the different powers exercised by them it will appear
 that there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than
 uniform plan with respect to the limits of commonlaw and equitable
 jurisdictions shall be adopted by the different states to devise
 likely that new york or some other state would have been preferred 
 but admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in
 and essential object of introducing a firm national government
i cannot but persuade myself on the other hand that the
 many cases in which that mode of trial now prevails for my part i
 acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this state it might

 warmest defenders of popular liberty but who have rarely suffered
 happen and are in no case necessary but where the validity of a
 devise of land comes into question
 shall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on
 these miscellaneous points in a single paper
 government we find the following article  section  clause  
 judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to
 levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies giving
 them aid and comfort no person shall be convicted of treason
 without accusation or trial would be so gross and notorious an act
 of despotism as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout
 and to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the
 revolution this consequently can be considered as no part of a

 constitution for the united states of america here is a better
 pretext to claim more than were granted for why declare that
 things shall not be done which there is no power to do why for
 nothing what signifies a declaration that the liberty of the
 press shall be inviolably preserved what is the liberty of the
 for the public security which are not to be found in any of the
 state constitutions is another object of a bill of rights to
 many of the states to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the
 constituent of the conduct of the representative body this
it is equally evident that the same sources of information would
 be open to the people in relation to the conduct of their
 that affect the general liberty and prosperity have the same
 interest with those who are at a distance and that they will stand
 recollect turns upon the article of expense if it were even true
 that the adoption of the proposed government would occasion a
 present number would in a more advanced stage of population be a
 very inadequate representation of the people

 the latter description the states individually will stand in no
