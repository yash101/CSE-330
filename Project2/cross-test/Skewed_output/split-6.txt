general introduction

to the people of the state of new york
 wrong election of the part we shall act may in this view deserve
 to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind
this idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of
 patriotism to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and
 good men must feel for the event happy will it be if our choice
 should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests
 elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial
 confederacies than from its union under one government
it is not however my design to dwell upon observations of this
 nature i am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve
 indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men merely because
 their situations might subject them to suspicion into interested or
 ambition avarice personal animosity party opposition and many
 other motives not more laudable than these are apt to operate as
 well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a
 question were there not even these inducements to moderation
 nothing could be more illjudged than that intolerant spirit which
 has at all times characterized political parties for in
 fault of the head than of the heart will be represented as mere
 pretense and artifice the stale bait for popularity at the expense
 of the public good it will be forgotten on the one hand that
 jealousy is the usual concomitant of love and that the noble
 enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow
 and illiberal distrust on the other hand it will be equally
 other than those which may result from the evidence of truth you
 will no doubt at the same time have collected from the general
 scope of them that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the
 new constitution yes my countrymen i own to you that after
 having given it an attentive consideration i am clearly of opinion
 it is your interest to adopt it i am convinced that this is the
 equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this
 object  the conformity of the proposed constitution to the true
 principles of republican government 
 its analogy to your own state constitution 
 and lastly the additional security which its
 adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of
 able to take an enlarged view of the subject than the alternative
 of an adoption of the new constitution or a dismemberment of the
 union it will therefore be of use to begin by examining the
 advantages of that union the certain evils and the probable
 dangers to which every state will be exposed from its dissolution
 this shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address
 government and it is equally undeniable that whenever and however
 it is instituted the people must cede to it some of their natural
 rights in order to vest it with requisite powers it is well worthy
 of consideration therefore whether it would conduce more to the
 interest of the people of america that they should to all general
 purposes be one nation under one federal government or that they
 gentlemen it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to
 adopt these new political tenets without being fully convinced that
 they are founded in truth and sound policy
it has often given me pleasure to observe that independent
 america was not composed of detached and distant territories but
 that one connected fertile widespreading country was the portion
 by side throughout a long and bloody war have nobly established
 general liberty and independence
this country and this people seem to have been made for each
 other and it appears as if it was the design of providence that an
 inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren united
 to each other by the strongest ties should never be split into a
 calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede
 the formation of a wise and wellbalanced government for a free
 people it is not to be wondered at that a government instituted
 in times so inauspicious should on experiment be found greatly
 deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer
this intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects
admit for so is the fact that this plan is only recommended
 not imposed yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended
 to blind approbation nor to blind reprobation but to that sedate
 and candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the
 subject demand and which it certainly ought to receive but this
 as was remarked in the foregoing number of this paper is more to
 and decided judiciously and happy they are in reflecting that they
 did so
they considered that the congress was composed of many wise and
 experienced men that being convened from different parts of the
 country they brought with them and communicated to each other a
 variety of useful information that in the course of the time they
 who have been since tried and justly approved for patriotism and
 abilities and who have grown old in acquiring political
 information were also members of this convention and carried into
 it their accumulated knowledge and experience
it is worthy of remark that not only the first but every
 succeeding congress as well as the late convention have invariably
 continuance of the union in the utmost jeopardy that certainly
 would be the case and i sincerely wish that it may be as clearly
 foreseen by every good citizen that whenever the dissolution of the
 union arrives america will have reason to exclaim in the words of
 the poet farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
publius
 which appear to have given birth to this opinion the more i become
 convinced that they are cogent and conclusive
among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it
 necessary to direct their attention that of providing for their
 safety seems to be the first the safety of the people doubtless
 has relation to a great variety of circumstances and considerations
 whether so many just causes of war are likely to be given by united
 america as by disunited america for if it should turn out that
 united america will probably give the fewest then it will follow
 that in this respect the union tends most to preserve the people in
 a state of peace with other nations
the just causes of war for the most part arise either from
 men in state assemblies or senates or courts of justice or
 executive departments yet more general and extensive reputation for
 talents and other qualifications will be necessary to recommend men
 to offices under the national governmentespecially as it will have
 the widest field for choice and never experience that want of
 proper persons which is not uncommon in some of the states hence
 only to one national government cannot be too much commended
because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often
 tempt the governing party in one or two states to swerve from good
 faith and justice but those temptations not reaching the other
 states and consequently having little or no influence on the
 national government the temptation will be fruitless and good
 safety of the people
as to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and
 unlawful violence it appears equally clear to me that one good
 national government affords vastly more security against dangers of
 that sort than can be derived from any other quarter
because such violences are more frequently caused by the
 which actuate the parties immediately interested
but not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the
 national government but it will also be more in their power to
 accommodate and settle them amicably they will be more temperate
 and cool and in that respect as well as in others will be more in
 capacity to act advisedly than the offending state the pride of
 occasion either have demanded or have received the like humiliation
 from spain or britain or any other powerful nation

the same subject continued
concerning dangers from foreign force and influence
 well as just causes of war
it is too true however disgraceful it may be to human nature
 that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect
 of getting anything by it nay absolute monarchs will often make
 war when their nations are to get nothing by it but for the
 purposes and objects merely personal such as thirst for military
 navigation and the carrying trade and we shall deceive ourselves
 if we suppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish
 for as our carrying trade cannot increase without in some degree
 diminishing theirs it is more their interest and will be more
 their policy to restrain than to promote it
in the trade to china and india we interfere with more than one
from these and such like considerations which might if
 consistent with prudence be more amplified and detailed it is easy
 to see that jealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide into the
 minds and cabinets of other nations and that we are not to expect
 that they should regard our advancement in union in power and
 consequence by land and by sea with an eye of indifference and
 whatever
one government can collect and avail itself of the talents and
 experience of the ablest men in whatever part of the union they may
 be found it can move on uniform principles of policy it can
 harmonize assimilate and protect the several parts and members
 and extend the benefit of its foresight and precautions to each in
 governments if they agreed at all be able with all their
 respective forces to operate against the enemy so effectually as
 the single government of great britain would
we have heard much of the fleets of britain and the time may
 come if we are wise when the fleets of america may engage
 attention but if one national government had not so regulated the
 by its specious promises or seduced by a too great fondness for
 peace to decline hazarding their tranquillity and present safety for
 the sake of neighbors of whom perhaps they have been jealous and
 whose importance they are content to see diminished although such
 conduct would not be wise it would nevertheless be natural the
 history of the states of greece and of other countries abounds
 certain it is that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as
 it is and they will act toward us accordingly if they see that
 our national government is efficient and well administered our
 trade prudently regulated our militia properly organized and
 disciplined our resources and finances discreetly managed our
 credit reestablished our people free contented and united they

to the people of the state of new york
queen anne in her letter of the st july  to the scotch
 parliament makes some observations on the importance of the union
 then forming between england and scotland which merit our attention 
 divisions at home would invite dangers from abroad and that
 nothing would tend more to secure us from them than union strength
 and good government within ourselves this subject is copious and
 cannot easily be exhausted
the history of great britain is the one with which we are in
 general the best acquainted and it gives us many useful lessons
 different interests envy and jealousy would soon extinguish
 confidence and affection and the partial interests of each
 confederacy instead of the general interests of all america would
 be the only objects of their policy and pursuits hence like most
 other bordering nations they would always be either involved in
 disputes and war or live in the constant apprehension of them
 it would that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise
 on the scale of political importance much above the degree of her
 neighbors that moment would those neighbors behold her with envy
 and with fear both those passions would lead them to countenance
 if not to promote whatever might promise to diminish her
 importance and would also restrain them from measures calculated
 tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and milder air
 of their luxurious and more delicate neighbors
they who well consider the history of similar divisions and
 confederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in
 contemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they
 would be borderers that they would neither love nor trust one
 productions and commodities are different and proper for different
 markets so would those treaties be essentially different
 different commercial concerns must create different interests and
 of course different degrees of political attachment to and
 connection with different foreign nations hence it might and
 probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the southern
 into our country than it is to persuade or compel them to depart
 how many conquests did the romans and others make in the characters
 of allies and what innovations did they under the same character
 introduce into the governments of those whom they pretended to
 protect
let candid men judge then whether the division of america into
 factions and convulsions these have been already in some instances
 slightly anticipated but they deserve a more particular and more
 full investigation
a man must be far gone in utopian speculations who can seriously
 doubt that if these states should either be wholly disunited or
 only united in partial confederacies the subdivisions into which
 commerce between commercial nations and there are others not less
 numerous than either of the former which take their origin entirely
 in private passions in the attachments enmities interests
 hopes and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which
 they are members men of this class whether the favorites of a
 king or of a people have in too many instances abused the
 intermissions and renewals terminated in the ruin of the athenian
 commonwealth
the ambitious cardinal who was prime minister to henry viii
 permitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown
 entertained hopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid
 prize by the influence of the emperor charles v to secure the
 according to their direction would be an unnecessary waste of time
 those who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from
 which they are to be drawn will themselves recollect a variety of
 instances and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature
 will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either
 of the reality or extent of that agency perhaps however a
 mutual amity and concord
is it not we may ask these projectors in politics the true
 interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and
 philosophic spirit if this be their true interest have they in
 fact pursued it has it not on the contrary invariably been found
 that momentary passions and immediate interest have a more active
 become the prevailing system of nations as were before occasioned
 by the cupidity of territory or dominion has not the spirit of
 commerce in many instances administered new incentives to the
 appetite both for the one and for the other let experience the
 least fallible guide of human opinions be appealed to for an answer
 to these inquiries

it is sometimes asked with an air of seeming triumph what
 inducements could the states have if disunited to make war upon
 each other it would be a full answer to this question to
 sayprecisely the same inducements which have at different times
 deluged in blood all the nations in the world but unfortunately
 for us the question admits of a more particular answer there are
 at the time of the revolution and which usually went under the name
 of crown lands the states within the limits of whose colonial
 governments they were comprised have claimed them as their property
 the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this
 article devolved upon the union especially as to all that part of
 the western territory which either by actual possession or through
 grant had ceased to reclaim the lands as a reversion the other
 states would no doubt insist on a proportion by right of
 representation their argument would be that a grant once made
 could not be revoked and that the justice of participating in
 territory acquired or secured by the joint efforts of the
 confederacy remained undiminished if contrary to probability it
 to submit the matter to the decision of a federal court the
 submission was made and the court decided in favor of pennsylvania
 but connecticut gave strong indications of dissatisfaction with
 that determination nor did she appear to be entirely resigned to
 it till by negotiation and management something like an
 equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have
 lands under the actual government of that district even the states
 which brought forward claims in contradiction to ours seemed more
 solicitous to dismember this state than to establish their own
 pretensions these were new hampshire massachusetts and
 connecticut new jersey and rhode island upon all occasions
 discovered a warm zeal for the independence of vermont and
 privileges to which we have been accustomed since the earliest
 settlement of the country would give a keener edge to those causes
 of discontent than they would naturally have independent of this
 circumstance we should be ready to denominate injuries those
 things which were in reality the justifiable acts of independent
 sovereignties consulting a distinct interest the spirit of
 capacity of consumers of what we import new york would neither be
 willing nor able to forego this advantage her citizens would not
 consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of the
 citizens of her neighbors nor would it be practicable if there
 were not this impediment in the way to distinguish the customers in
 our own markets would connecticut and new jersey long submit to be
 usual would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the parties
 there are even dissimilar views among the states as to the general
 principle of discharging the public debt some of them either less
 impressed with the importance of national credit or because their
 citizens have little if any immediate interest in the question
 feel an indifference if not a repugnance to the payment of the
 upon some states than upon others those which were sufferers by it
 would naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden the others
 would as naturally be disinclined to a revision which was likely to
 end in an increase of their own incumbrances their refusal would
 be too plausible a pretext to the complaining states to withhold
 their contributions not to be embraced with avidity and the
 trite that there is nothing men differ so readily about as the
 payment of money
laws in violation of private contracts as they amount to
 aggressions on the rights of those states whose citizens are injured
 by them may be considered as another probable source of hostility
 we are not authorized to expect that a more liberal or more
 tie of a simple league offensive and defensive would by the
 operation of such jarring alliances be gradually entangled in all
 the pernicious labyrinths of european politics and wars and by the
 destructive contentions of the parts into which she was divided
 would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations
 of powers equally the enemies of them all divide et
 happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general confederacy
 would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war of
 friendship and enmity with each other which have fallen to the lot
 of all neighboring nations not united under one government let us
 enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would
 attend such a situation
 heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as intelligence of its
 approach could be received but now a comparatively small force of
 disciplined troops acting on the defensive with the aid of posts
 is able to impede and finally to frustrate the enterprises of one
 much more considerable the history of war in that quarter of the
 globe is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires
 the most powerful director of national conduct even the ardent
 love of liberty will after a time give way to its dictates the
 violent destruction of life and property incident to war the
 continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger
 will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for
 repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy
 defense by disciplined troops and by fortifications they would
 at the same time be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of
 government in doing which their constitutions would acquire a
 progressive direction toward monarchy it is of the nature of war
 to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative
 authority
 accommodated to this standard
these are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or
 speculative defects in a constitution the whole power of which is
 lodged in the hands of a people or their representatives and
 delegates but they are solid conclusions drawn from the natural
 and necessary progress of human affairs
there is a wide difference also between military
 establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to
 internal invasions and in one which is often subject to them and
 always apprehensive of them the rulers of the former can have a
 good pretext if they are even so inclined to keep on foot armies
 so numerous as must of necessity be maintained in the latter these
 efforts of the great body of the people
in a country in the predicament last described the contrary of
 all this happens the perpetual menacings of danger oblige the
 government to be always prepared to repel it its armies must be
 numerous enough for instant defense the continual necessity for
 their services enhances the importance of the soldier and
 to make head against a sudden descent till the militia could have
 time to rally and embody is all that has been deemed requisite no
 motive of national policy has demanded nor would public opinion
 have tolerated a larger number of troops upon its domestic
 establishment there has been for a long time past little room
 for the operation of the other causes which have been enumerated as
 europe is at a great distance from us her colonies in our
 vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in
 strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance extensive
 military establishments cannot in this position be necessary to
 our security but if we should be disunited and the integral parts
 should either remain separated or which is most probable should
publius
 this objection will be fully examined in its proper place and
 it will be shown that the only natural precaution which could have
 been taken on this subject has been taken and a much better one
 than is to be found in any constitution that has been heretofore
 framed in america most of which contain no guard at all on this
 succeed if now and then intervals of felicity open to view we
 behold them with a mixture of regret arising from the reflection
 that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the
 tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage if momentary rays of
 glory break forth from the gloom while they dazzle us with a
 transient and fleeting brilliancy they at the same time admonish us
but it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched
 of republican government were too just copies of the originals from
 which they were taken if it had been found impracticable to have
 devised models of a more perfect structure the enlightened friends
 to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that
 species of government as indefensible the science of politics
 new constitution i mean the enlargement of the orbit within which
 such systems are to revolve either in respect to the dimensions of
 a single state or to the consolidation of several smaller states
 into one great confederacy the latter is that which immediately
 concerns the object under consideration it will however be of
 use to examine the principle in its application to a single state
 of almost every one of these states neither virginia
 massachusetts pennsylvania new york north carolina nor georgia
 can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned
 and to which the terms of his description apply if we therefore
 take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth we shall be
 driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the
 emphatically quoted upon the occasion it would only dictate a
 reduction of the size of the more considerable members of the union
 but would not militate against their being all comprehended in one
 confederate government and this is the true question in the
 discussion of which we are at present interested
so far are the suggestions of montesquieu from standing in
 able to provide for the security of the united body
a republic of this kind able to withstand an external force
 may support itself without any internal corruptions the form of
 this society prevents all manner of inconveniences
if a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme
 authority he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and
 passages because they contain a luminous abridgment of the
 principal arguments in favor of the union and must effectually
 remove the false impressions which a misapplication of other parts
 of the work was calculated to make they have at the same time an
 intimate connection with the more immediate design of this paper
 which is to illustrate the tendency of the union to repress
 serve to prove as far as example will go that there is no absolute
 rule on the subject and it will be clearly shown in the course of
 this investigation that as far as the principle contended for has
 prevailed it has been the cause of incurable disorder and
 imbecility in the government
the definition of a confederate republic seems simply to be an
 cities or republics the largest were entitled to three votes in the
 common council those of the middle class to two and the smallest
 to one the common council had the appointment of all the judges
 and magistrates of the respective cities this was certainly the
 most delicate species of interference in their internal
 administration for if there be any thing that seems exclusively

among the numerous advantages promised by a wellconstructed
 union none deserves to be more accurately developed than its
 tendency to break and control the violence of faction the friend
 of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their
 and of public and personal liberty that our governments are too
 unstable that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of
 rival parties and that measures are too often decided not
 according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party
 but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority
 however anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no
 aggregate interests of the community
there are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction the
 one by removing its causes the other by controlling its effects
there are again two methods of removing the causes of faction
 the one by destroying the liberty which is essential to its
 existence the other by giving to every citizen the same opinions
 of men from which the rights of property originate is not less an
 insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests the protection
 of these faculties is the first object of government from the
 protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property
 the possession of different degrees and kinds of property
 immediately results and from the influence of these on the
 and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their
 unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts but
 the most common and durable source of factions has been the various
 and unequal distribution of property those who hold and those who
 are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society
 those who are creditors and those who are debtors fall under a
 citizens and what are the different classes of legislators but
 advocates and parties to the causes which they determine is a law
 proposed concerning private debts it is a question to which the
 creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other
 justice ought to hold the balance between them yet the parties
 are and must be themselves the judges and the most numerous
 helm nor in many cases can such an adjustment be made at all
 without taking into view indirect and remote considerations which
 will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may
 find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole
the inference to which we are brought is that the causes of
 faction cannot be removed and that relief is only to be sought in
 recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind
by what means is this object attainable evidently by one of
 two only either the existence of the same passion or interest in a
 majority at the same time must be prevented or the majority having
 such coexistent passion or interest must be rendered by their
 number and local situation unable to concert and carry into effect
 contention have ever been found incompatible with personal
 security or the rights of property and have in general been as
 short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths
 theoretic politicians who have patronized this species of
 government have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a
 perfect equality in their political rights they would at the same
 medium of a chosen body of citizens whose wisdom may best discern
 the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of
 justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial
 considerations under such a regulation it may well happen that
 the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people
 will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the
 the small republic it follows that if the proportion of fit
 characters be not less in the large than in the small republic the
 former will present a greater option and consequently a greater
 probability of a fit choice
in the next place as each representative will be chosen by a
 greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic
the other point of difference is the greater number of citizens
 and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of
 republican than of democratic government and it is this
 circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to
 be dreaded in the former than in the latter the smaller the
 society the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and
 republic has over a democracy in controlling the effects of
 faction is enjoyed by a large over a small republicis enjoyed by
 the union over the states composing it does the advantage consist
 in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and
 virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and
 schemes of injustice it will not be denied that the representation
 rage for paper money for an abolition of debts for an equal
 division of property or for any other improper or wicked project
 will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the union than a
 particular member of it in the same proportion as such a malady is
 more likely to taint a particular county or district than an entire
 state
 general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject
 this applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries as
 with each other
there are appearances to authorize a supposition that the
 adventurous spirit which distinguishes the commercial character of
 america has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the
 trace by facts the workings of this policy to the cabinets of
 ministers
if we continue united we may counteract a policy so unfriendly
 to our prosperity in a variety of ways by prohibitory regulations
 extending at the same time throughout the states we may oblige
 foreign countries to bid against each other for the privileges of
 questions have been asked upon other occasions they have received
 a plausible but not a solid or satisfactory answer it has been
 said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the
 system of britain because she could prosecute her trade with us
 through the medium of the dutch who would be her immediate
 customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for
 islands would produce a relaxation in her present system and would
 let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those
 islands elsewhere from which our trade would derive the most
 substantial benefits such a point gained from the british
 government and which could not be expected without an equivalent in
 exemptions and immunities in our markets would be likely to have a
 consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this
 country in the prosecution of military operations in the west
 indies it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable
 would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial
 privileges a price would be set not only upon our friendship but
 upon our neutrality by a steady adherence to the union we may
 resources of the country directed to a common interest would
 baffle all the combinations of european jealousy to restrain our
 growth this situation would even take away the motive to such
 combinations by inducing an impracticability of success an active
 commerce an extensive navigation and a flourishing marine would
 then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity we might
 national wealth would be stifled and lost and poverty and disgrace
 would overspread a country which with wisdom might make herself
 the admiration and envy of the world
there are rights of great moment to the trade of america which
 are rights of the unioni allude to the fisheries to the navigation
 of the western lakes and to that of the mississippi the
 greater extension of mercantile capital would not be unlikely to do
 it as a nursery of seamen it now is or when time shall have more
 nearly assimilated the principles of navigation in the several
 states will become a universal resource to the establishment of
 a navy it must be indispensable

the ability of a country to pay taxes must always be
 proportioned in a great degree to the quantity of money in
 circulation and to the celerity with which it circulates
 commerce contributing to both these objects must of necessity

 methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried the

 coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and

 reluctantly yield but scanty supplies in the unwelcome shape of
 impositions on their houses and lands and personal property is too
 precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way
 than by the inperceptible agency of taxes on consumption
if these remarks have any foundation that state of things which
 these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit
 trade between them a matter of little difficulty and would insure
 frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other the
 separate states or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual
 jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the
 lowness of their duties the temper of our governments for a long
 with which the patrols are necessarily armed would be intolerable

 consisting of the four northern another of the four middle and a
 third of the five southern states there is little probability that
 there would be a greater number according to this distribution
 each confederacy would comprise an extent of territory larger than
 that of the kingdom of great britain no wellinformed man will
 suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy can be properly
 diffusing its force to a very great extent and can in a manner
 reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious
 arrangement of subordinate institutions
the supposition that each confederacy into which the states
 would be likely to be divided would require a government not less
 comprehensive than the one proposed will be strengthened by another
 league an active foreign commerce on the basis of her own
 navigation is her true policy and coincides with the opinions and
 dispositions of her citizens the more southern states from
 various circumstances may not think themselves much interested in
 the encouragement of navigation they may prefer a system which
 would give unlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well
 however which when we come to take a nearer view of it will
 appear in every light to stand on mistaken ground
if in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil
 lists we take into view the number of persons who must necessarily
 be employed to guard the inland communication between the different
 confederacies against illicit trade and who in time will infallibly
we have seen the necessity of the union as our bulwark against
 foreign danger as the conservator of peace among ourselves as the
 guardian of our commerce and other common interests as the only
 substitute for those military establishments which have subverted
 the liberties of the old world and as the proper antidote for the
 diseases of faction which have proved fatal to other popular
 true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a
 former occasion it is that in a democracy the people meet and
 exercise the government in person in a republic they assemble and
 administer it by their representatives and agents a democracy
 consequently will be confined to a small spot a republic may be
 extended over a large region
 representation no example is seen of a government wholly popular
 and founded at the same time wholly on that principle if europe
 has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in
 government by the simple agency of which the will of the largest
 political body may be concentred and its force directed to any
 object which the public good requires america can claim the merit
 the representatives of the states have been almost continually
 assembled and that the members from the most distant states are not
 chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance than those from
 the states in the neighborhood of congress
that we may form a juster estimate with regard to this
 interesting subject let us resort to the actual dimensions of the
 great deal larger than germany where a diet representing the whole
 empire is continually assembled or than poland before the late
 dismemberment where another national diet was the depositary of the
 supreme power passing by france and spain we find that in great
 britain inferior as it may be in size the representatives of the
 northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the

 principle of selfpreservation to reinstate them in their proper
 jurisdiction
a second observation to be made is that the immediate object of
 the federal constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen
 primitive states which we know to be practicable and to add to
 intersected our country and which art finds it so little difficult
 to connect and complete
a fourth and still more important consideration is that as
 almost every state will on one side or other be a frontier and
 will thus find in regard to its safety an inducement to make some
 sacrifices for the sake of the general protection so the states
i submit to you my fellowcitizens these considerations in
 full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your
 decisions will allow them their due weight and effect and that you
 will never suffer difficulties however formidable in appearance or
 however fashionable the error on which they may be founded to drive
 you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for
 of their becoming aliens rivals enemies and if novelties are to
 be shunned believe me the most alarming of all novelties the most
 wild of all projects the most rash of all attempts is that of
 rendering us in pieces in order to preserve our liberties and
 promote our happiness but why is the experiment of an extended
 republic to be rejected merely because it may comprise what is new
 of mankind happily for america happily we trust for the whole
 human race they pursued a new and more noble course they
 accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of
 human society they reared the fabrics of governments which have no
 model on the face of the globe they formed the design of a great
 confederacy which it is incumbent on their successors to improve
 happiness i have unfolded to you a complication of dangers to
 which you would be exposed should you permit that sacred knot which
 binds the people of america together be severed or dissolved by
 ambition or by avarice by jealousy or by misrepresentation in the
 sequel of the inquiry through which i propose to accompany you the
 truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation
 controverted or doubted to which the understandings and feelings of
 all classes of men assent and which in substance is admitted by the
 opponents as well as by the friends of the new constitution it
 must in truth be acknowledged that however these may differ in
 other respects they in general appear to harmonize in this
 sentiment at least that there are material imperfections in our
 owe debts to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted in a time
 of imminent peril for the preservation of our political existence
 these remain without any proper or satisfactory provision for their
 discharge have we valuable territories and important posts in the
 possession of a foreign power which by express stipulations ought
 long since to have been surrendered these are still retained to
 of national distress the price of improved land in most parts of
 the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity
 of waste land at market and can only be fully explained by that
 want of private and public confidence which are so alarmingly
 prevalent among all ranks and which have a direct tendency to
 depreciate property of every kind is private credit the friend and
 people let us make a firm stand for our safety our tranquillity

 which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and
 prosperity
it is true as has been before observed that facts too stubborn
 to be resisted have produced a species of general assent to the
 from fundamental errors in the structure of the building which
 cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first
 principles and main pillars of the fabric
the great and radical vice in the construction of the existing
 confederation is in the principle of legislation for states or
 governments in their corporate or collective capacities and as
 the bane of the old and which is in itself evidently incompatible
 with the idea of government a principle in short which if it is
 to be executed at all must substitute the violent and sanguinary
 agency of the sword to the mild influence of the magistracy
there is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league
 or alliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes
 have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith and which
 oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of
 any immediate interest or passion
if the particular states in this country are disposed to stand
 in a similar relation to each other and to drop the project of a
 general discretionary superintendence the scheme would indeed be
 citizens the only proper objects of government
government implies the power of making laws it is essential to
 the idea of a law that it be attended with a sanction or in
 other words a penalty or punishment for disobedience if there be
 no penalty annexed to disobedience the resolutions or commands
 which pretend to be laws will in fact amount to nothing more than
 any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it
there was a time when we were told that breaches by the states
 of the regulations of the federal authority were not to be expected
 that a sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of
 the respective members and would beget a full compliance with all
 the constitutional requisitions of the union this language at the
 deliberations of all bodies of men will often hurry the persons of
 whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses for which
 they would blush in a private capacity
in addition to all this there is in the nature of sovereign
 power an impatience of control that disposes those who are
 invested with the exercise of it to look with an evil eye upon all
 this results from the constitution of human nature
if therefore the measures of the confederacy cannot be
 executed without the intervention of the particular administrations
 there will be little prospect of their being executed at all the
 rulers of the respective members whether they have a constitutional
 right to do it or not will undertake to judge of the propriety of
 important points will readily conceive how impossible it must be to
 induce a number of such assemblies deliberating at a distance from
 each other at different times and under different impressions
 long to cooperate in the same views and pursuits
in our case the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign
 wills is requisite under the confederation to the complete
 who are embarked with us in the same political voyage why should
 we consent to bear more than our proper share of the common burden
 these were suggestions which human selfishness could not withstand
 and which even speculative men who looked forward to remote
 consequences could not without hesitation combat each state
 yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate interest or
 exemplified by the experiment we have made of it is equally
 attested by the events which have befallen all other governments of
 the confederate kind of which we have any account in exact
 proportion to its prevalence in those systems the confirmations of
 this fact will be worthy of a distinct and particular examination
 i shall content myself with barely observing here that of all the
 at all or when this could be done it would amount to a war
 between parts of the confederacy concerning the infractions of a
 league in which the strongest combination would be most likely to
 prevail whether it consisted of those who supported or of those who
 resisted the general authority it would rarely happen that the
 delinquency to be redressed would be confined to a single member
 better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand
 with leading individuals in the adjacent states if associates
 could not be found at home recourse would be had to the aid of
 foreign powers who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the
 dissensions of a confederacy from the firm union of which they had
 so much to fear when the sword is once drawn the passions of men
 guilt of all would thus become the security of all our past
 experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in its full
 light there would in fact be an insuperable difficulty in
 ascertaining when force could with propriety be employed in the
 article of pecuniary contribution which would be the most usual
 source of delinquency it would often be impossible to decide
 military despotism but it will be found in every light
 impracticable the resources of the union would not be equal to the
 maintenance of an army considerable enough to confine the larger
 states within the limits of their duty nor would the means ever be
 furnished of forming such an army in the first instance whoever
 considers the populousness and strength of several of these states
 banners against the other half
the result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be
 clearly this that if it be possible at any rate to construct a
 federal government capable of regulating the common concerns and
 preserving the general tranquillity it must be founded as to the
 objects committed to its care upon the reverse of the principle
 time obstruct the execution of its laws and bring the matter to the
 same issue of force with the necessity of which the opposite scheme
 is reproached
the pausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we
 advert to the essential difference between a mere noncompliance and
 a direct and active resistance if the interposition of the state
 they had encroached on the national rights an experiment of this
 nature would always be hazardous in the face of a constitution in
 any degree competent to its own defense and of a people enlightened
 enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and an illegal
 usurpation of authority the success of it would require not merely
 a factious majority in the legislature but the concurrence of the
 equally the ministers of the law of the land from whatever source
 it might emanate would doubtless be as ready to guard the national
 as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiousness

 retainers who occupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of
 fealty or obedience to the persons of whom they held it each

 opposition to authority of the sovereign and frequent wars between

 detested by both till mutual danger and mutual interest effected a

 that of the grecian republics associated under the amphictyonic
 council from the best accounts transmitted of this celebrated
 institution it bore a very instructive analogy to the present

one important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians
 who take notice of achaean affairs it is that as well after the
 renovation of the league by aratus as before its dissolution by the
 arts of macedon there was infinitely more of moderation and justice

 should be ascribed to the federal head as resulting from the nature
 of the social compact between the states it must be by inference
 and construction in the face of that part of the second article by
 which it is declared that each state shall retain every power
 jurisdiction and right not expressly delegated to the united
 states in congress assembled there is doubtless a striking
 another capital imperfection in the federal plan there is nothing
 of this kind declared in the articles that compose it and to imply
 a tacit guaranty from considerations of utility would be a still
 more flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned
 than to imply a tacit power of coercion from the like considerations
 the want of a guaranty though it might in its consequences
 can predict what effect a despotism established in massachusetts
 would have upon the liberties of new hampshire or rhode island of
 connecticut or new york
the inordinate pride of state importance has suggested to some
 minds an objection to the principle of a guaranty in the federal
 government as involving an officious interference in the domestic
 national authority would be as much levelled against the usurpations
 of rulers as against the ferments and outrages of faction and
 sedition in the community
the principle of regulating the contributions of the states to
 the common treasury by quotas is another fundamental error in the
 confederation its repugnancy to an adequate supply of the national
 comparison between the proportion of either of these two objects and
 that of the relative wealth of those nations if the like parallel
 were to be run between several of the american states it would
 furnish a like result let virginia be contrasted with north
 carolina pennsylvania with connecticut or maryland with new
 jersey and we shall be convinced that the respective abilities of
 of different countries the consequence clearly is that there can
 be no common measure of national wealth and of course no general
 or stationary rule by which the ability of a state to pay taxes can
 be determined the attempt therefore to regulate the
 contributions of the members of a confederacy by any such rule
 cannot fail to be productive of glaring inequality and extreme
 time find its level with the means of paying them the amount to
 be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own
 option and can be regulated by an attention to his resources the
 rich may be extravagant the poor can be frugal and private
 oppression may always be avoided by a judicious selection of objects
 proper for such impositions if inequalities should arise in some
 if duties are too high they lessen the consumption the
 collection is eluded and the product to the treasury is not so
 great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds
 this forms a complete barrier against any material oppression of
 the citizens by taxes of this class and is itself a natural
 limitation of the power of imposing them

 incompatible with the end may be attended with fewer inconveniences

the power of raising armies by the most obvious construction of
 the articles of the confederation is merely a power of making
 requisitions upon the states for quotas of men this practice in
 have induced the people to endure
this method of raising troops is not more unfriendly to economy
 and vigor than it is to an equal distribution of the burden the
 states near the seat of war influenced by motives of
 selfpreservation made efforts to furnish their quotas which even
 exceeded their abilities while those at a distance from danger
 and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a
 principle which gives to rhode island an equal weight in the scale
 of power with massachusetts or connecticut or new york and to
 deleware an equal voice in the national deliberations with
 pennsylvania or virginia or north carolina its operation
 contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government which
 smaller states considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare
 depend on union ought readily to renounce a pretension which if
 not relinquished would prove fatal to its duration
it may be objected to this that not seven but nine states or
 two thirds of the whole number must consent to the most important

 minority and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule

 in each state a court of final jurisdiction there may be as many
 different final determinations on the same point as there are courts
 there are endless diversities in the opinions of men we often
 would be reason to apprehend that the provisions of the particular
 laws might be preferred to those of the general laws for nothing
 is more natural to men in office than to look with peculiar
 deference towards that authority to which they owe their official
 existence the treaties of the united states under the present
 constitution are liable to the infractions of thirteen different
 preconceived opinions that it is a system so radically vicious and
 unsound as to admit not of amendment but by an entire change in its
 leading features and characters
the organization of congress is itself utterly improper for the
 exercise of those powers which are necessary to be deposited in the
 union a single assembly may be a proper receptacle of those
 important prerogatives of sovereignty and thus entail upon our
 posterity one of the most execrable forms of government that human
 infatuation ever contrived thus we should create in reality that
 very tyranny which the adversaries of the new constitution either
 are or affect to be solicitous to avert
it has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the
 original fountain of all legitimate authority

 the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those
 objects the persons upon whom that power ought to operate its
 distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention
 under the succeeding head
the principal purposes to be answered by union are these the
 coextensive with all the possible combinations of such
 circumstances and ought to be under the direction of the same
 councils which are appointed to preside over the common defense
this is one of those truths which to a correct and unprejudiced
 mind carries its own evidence along with it and may be obscured
 but cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning it rests upon
 any matter essential to its efficacy that is in any matter
 essential to the formation direction or support of the national
 forces
defective as the present confederation has been proved to be
 this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the framers
 of it though they have not made proper or adequate provision for
 change in the first principles of the system that if we are in
 earnest about giving the union energy and duration we must abandon
 the vain project of legislating upon the states in their collective
 capacities we must extend the laws of the federal government to
 the individual citizens of america we must discard the fallacious
 scheme of quotas and requisitions as equally impracticable and
 relation to them the same must be the case in respect to commerce
 and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is permitted to
 extend is the administration of justice between the citizens of
 the same state the proper department of the local governments
 these must possess all the authorities which are connected with
 this object and with every other that may be allotted to their
 which the common safety is to be secured is there not a manifest
 inconsistency in devolving upon the federal government the care of
 the general defense and leaving in the state governments the
 effective powers by which it is to be provided for is not a want
 of cooperation the infallible consequence of such a system and
 will not weakness disorder an undue distribution of the burdens
 powers which a free people ought to delegate to any government
 would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the national interests
 wherever these can with propriety be confided the coincident
 powers may safely accompany them this is the true result of all
 just reasoning upon the subject and the adversaries of the plan
 promulgated by the convention ought to have confined themselves to
 the most essential national interests without daring to trust it to
 the authorities which are indispensible to their proper and
 efficient management let us not attempt to reconcile
 contradictions but firmly embrace a rational alternative
i trust however that the impracticability of one general
 system cannot be shown i am greatly mistaken if any thing of
the powers necessary to the common defense further considered

to the powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal
 government in respect to the creation and direction of the national
 constitutions and rejected in all the rest
a stranger to our politics who was to read our newspapers at
 the present juncture without having previously inspected the plan
 reported by the convention would be naturally led to one of two
 conclusions either that it contained a positive injunction that
 standing armies should be kept up in time of peace or that it
 of troops without evident necessity
disappointed in his first surmise the person i have supposed
 would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further he would
 naturally say to himself it is impossible that all this vehement
 and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable pretext it
 must needs be that this people so jealous of their liberties have
 deceive or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be
 ingenuous it would probably occur to him that he would be likely
 to find the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact
 between the states here at length he would expect to meet with a
 solution of the enigma no doubt he would observe to himself the
 existing confederation must contain the most explicit provisions
 country how else he would say could the authors of them have
 been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that plan about a
 point in which it seems to have conformed itself to the general
 sense of america as declared in its different forms of government
 and in which it has even superadded a new and powerful guard unknown
 to any of them if on the contrary he happened to be a man of
 society would be unlikely to be observed
though a wide ocean separates the united states from europe yet
 there are various considerations that warn us against an excess of
 confidence or security on one side of us and stretching far into
 our rear are growing settlements subject to the dominion of britain
 on the other side and extending to meet the british settlements
 political connection these circumstances combined admonish us not
 to be too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the
 reach of danger
previous to the revolution and ever since the peace there has
 been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our western
 frontier no person can doubt that these will continue to be
 here is a simple view of the subject that shows us at once the
 impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments
 and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and
 prudence of the legislature
in proportion to our increase in strength it is probable nay
 it may be said certain that britain and spain would augment their
 navy to this purpose there must be dockyards and arsenals and
 for the defense of these fortifications and probably garrisons
 when a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its
 dockyards by its fleets this supersedes the necessity of garrisons
 for that purpose but where naval establishments are in their
 infancy moderate garrisons will in all likelihood be found an
 of the other states except the foregoing and their constitutions
 are equally silent i am told however that one or two states have
 bills of rights which do not appear in this collection but that
 those also recognize the right of the legislative authority in this

 the union from maine to georgia the danger though in different
 degrees is therefore common and the means of guarding against it
 ought in like manner to be the objects of common councils and of a
 common treasury it happens that some states from local situation
 are more directly exposed new york is of this class upon the
 plan of separate provisions new york would have to sustain the
 situation military establishments nourished by mutual jealousy
 would be apt to swell beyond their natural or proper size and
 being at the separate disposal of the members they would be engines
 for the abridgment or demolition of the national authcrity
reasons have been already given to induce a supposition that the
 state governments will too naturally be prone to a rivalship with
 people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their
 rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the
 least suspicion
the framers of the existing confederation fully aware of the
 danger to the union from the separate possession of military forces
 by the states have in express terms prohibited them from having
 them up contrary to the sense of the constitution what time
 shall be requisite to ascertain the violation shall it be a week
 a month a year or shall we say they may be continued as long as
 the danger which occasioned their being raised continues this
 would be to admit that they might be kept up in time of peace
 against threatening or impending danger which would be at once to
 hostilities instigated by spain or britain would always be at hand
 provocations to produce the desired appearances might even be
 given to some foreign power and appeased again by timely
 concessions if we can reasonably presume such a combination to
 have been formed and that the enterprise is warranted by a
 sufficient prospect of success the army when once raised from
 liberty to the mercy of foreign invaders and invite them by our
 weakness to seize the naked and defenseless prey because we are
 afraid that rulers created by our choice dependent on our will
 might endanger that liberty by an abuse of the means necessary to
 its preservation
here i expect we shall be told that the militia of the country
 perserverance by time and by practice
all violent policy as it is contrary to the natural and
 experienced course of human affairs defeats itself pennsylvania
 at this instant affords an example of the truth of this remark
 the bill of rights of that state declares that standing armies are
 dangerous to liberty and ought not to be kept up in time of peace
 respect to control the legislative discretion it also teaches us
 in its application to the united states how little the rights of a
 feeble government are likely to be respected even by its own
 constituents and it teaches us in addition to the rest how
 unequal parchment provisions are to a struggle with public necessity
it was a fundamental maxim of the lacedaemonian commonwealth
 dictated by necessity impairs that sacred reverence which ought to
 be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a
 country and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same
 plea of necessity does not exist at all or is less urgent and
 palpable

 we shall never be likely to make any material change for the better
the idea of restraining the legislative authority in the means
 of providing for the national defense is one of those refinements
 which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than
 enlightened we have seen however that it has not had thus far an
 extensive prevalency that even in this country where it made its
 which upon other occasions have been condemned or forborne it
 may be affirmed without the imputation of invective that if the
 principles they inculcate on various points could so far obtain as
 to become the popular creed they would utterly unfit the people of
 this country for any species of government whatever but a danger
 of this kind is not to be apprehended the citizens of america have
 the barons and afterwards by the people till the greatest part of
 its most formidable pretensions became extinct but it was not till
 the revolution in  which elevated the prince of orange to the
 throne of great britain that english liberty was completely
 triumphant as incident to the undefined power of making war an
 acknowledged prerogative of the crown charles ii had by his own
 could be set to the national exigencies that a power equal to
 every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the government
 and that when they referred the exercise of that power to the
 judgment of the legislature they had arrived at the ultimate point
 of precaution which was reconcilable with the safety of the
 community
 call them unnecessary because the reason which had introduced a
 similar provision into the english bill of rights is not applicable
 to any of the state constitutions the power of raising armies at
 all under those constitutions can by no construction be deemed to
 reside anywhere else than in the legislatures themselves and it
 was superfluous if not absurd to declare that a matter should not
can it be doubted that such a provision whenever the situation
 of public affairs was understood to require a departure from it
 would be interpreted by the legislature into a mere admonition and
 would be made to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of
 the state let the fact already mentioned with respect to
 pennsylvania decide what then it may be asked is the use of
 by a formal vote in the face of their constituents they are not at
 liberty to vest in the executive department permanent funds for the
 support of an army if they were even incautious enough to be
 willing to repose in it so improper a confidence as the spirit of
 party in different degrees must be expected to infect all
 political bodies there will be no doubt persons in the national
 necessary the arm of their discontent
schemes to subvert the liberties of a great community require
 time to mature them for execution an army so large as seriously
 to menace those liberties could only be formed by progressive
 augmentations which would suppose not merely a temporary
 combination between the legislature and executive but a continued
 concerns in person
if such suppositions could even be reasonably made still the
 concealment of the design for any duration would be impracticable
 it would be announced by the very circumstance of augmenting the
 army to so great an extent in time of profound peace what
 colorable reason could be assigned in a country so situated for
 visionary as seriously to contend that military forces ought not to
 be raised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion and if the
 defense of the community under such circumstances should make it
 necessary to have an army so numerous as to hazard its liberty this
 is one of those calamaties for which there is neither preventative
 nor cure it cannot be provided against by any possible form of

 that the powers of the general government will be worse administered
 than those of the state government there seems to be no room for
 the presumption of illwill disaffection or opposition in the
 people i believe it may be laid down as a general rule that their
 confidence in and obedience to a government will commonly be
 proportioned to the goodness or badness of its administration it
 national councils and that they will be less apt to be tainted by
 the spirit of faction and more out of the reach of those occasional
 illhumors or temporary prejudices and propensities which in
 smaller societies frequently contaminate the public councils beget
 injustice and oppression of a part of the community and engender
 schemes which though they gratify a momentary inclination or
 degree of power can call to its aid the collective resources of the
 whole confederacy be more likely to repress the former sentiment
 and to inspire the latter than that of a single state which can
 only command the resources within itself a turbulent faction in a
 state may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends to
 the government in that state but it can hardly be so infatuated as
 will generally have but little influence upon his mind a
 government continually at a distance and out of sight can hardly be
 expected to interest the sensations of the people the inference
 is that the authority of the union and the affections of the
 citizens towards it will be strengthened rather than weakened by
 its extension to what are called matters of internal concern and
the plan reported by the convention by extending the authority
 of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several
 states will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy
 of each in the execution of its laws it is easy to perceive that
 this will tend to destroy in the common apprehension all
 distinction between the sources from which they might proceed and
 of this situation will perceive that there is good ground to
 calculate upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the
 union if its powers are administered with a common share of
 prudence if we will arbitrarily suppose the contrary we may
 deduce any inferences we please from the supposition for it is
 certainly possible by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of

that there may happen cases in which the national government may
 be necessitated to resort to force cannot be denied our own
 experience has corroborated the lessons taught by the examples of
 an insurrection whatever may be its immediate cause eventually
 endangers all government regard to the public peace if not to the
 rights of the union would engage the citizens to whom the contagion
 had not communicated itself to oppose the insurgents and if the
 general government should be found in practice conducive to the
 prosperity and felicity of the people it were irrational to believe
 governments themselves why should the possibility that the
 national government might be under a like necessity in similar
 extremities be made an objection to its existence is it not
 surprising that men who declare an attachment to the union in the
 abstract should urge as an objection to the proposed constitution
 what applies with tenfold weight to the plan for which they contend
 consideration acknowledge that the principle of the objection is
 equally applicable to either of the two cases and that whether we
 have one government for all the states or different governments for
 different parcels of them or even if there should be an entire
 separation of the states there might sometimes be a necessity to
 make use of a force constituted differently from the militia to
 than against those of the rulers of an individual state in a
 single state if the persons intrusted with supreme power become
 usurpers the different parcels subdivisions or districts of which
 it consists having no distinct government in each can take no
 regular measures for defense the citizens must rush tumultuously
 to arms without concert without system without resource except
 proportion to the artificial strength of the government is greater
 than in a small and of course more competent to a struggle with the
 attempts of the government to establish a tyranny but in a
 confederacy the people without exaggeration may be said to be
 entirely the masters of their own fate power being almost always
 the rival of power the general government will at all times stand
 confidence of the people they can at once adopt a regular plan of
 opposition in which they can combine all the resources of the
 community they can readily communicate with each other in the
 different states and unite their common forces for the protection
 of their common liberty
the great extent of the country is a further security we have
 an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the
 people of an immense empire who are in a situation through the
 medium of their state governments to take measures for their own
 defense with all the celerity regularity and system of
 independent nations the apprehension may be considered as a
 disease for which there can be found no cure in the resources of
 be attended with the most beneficial effects whenever they were
 called into service for the public defense it would enable them to
 discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual
 intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the
 operations of an army and it would fit them much sooner to acquire
 the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be
 certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that
 body which is constituted the guardian of the national security if
 standing armies are dangerous to liberty an efficacious power over
 the militia in the body to whose care the protection of the state
 is committed ought as far as possible to take away the inducement
 and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions if the federal
 favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair dealing of their authors
 the same persons who tell us in one breath that the powers of the
 federal government will be despotic and unlimited inform us in the
 next that it has not authority sufficient even to call out the
 posse comitatus the latter fortunately is as much short of the
 truth as the former exceeds it it would be as absurd to doubt
 think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in
 this manner how shall we prevent a conflict between charity and
 judgment
by a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy
 we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself in
 the hands of the federal government it is observed that select
 of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through
 military exercises and evolutions as often as might be necessary to
 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the
 character of a wellregulated militia would be a real grievance to
 the people and a serious public inconvenience and loss it would
 form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country
 to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent upon such
 principles as will really fit them for service in case of need by
 thus circumscribing the plan it will be possible to have an
 excellent body of welltrained militia ready to take the field
 whenever the defense of the state shall require it this will not
 only lessen the call for military establishments but if
 to treat it with gravity or with raillery whether to consider it
 as a mere trial of skill like the paradoxes of rhetoricians as a
 disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price or as the
 serious offspring of political fanaticism where in the name of
 commonsense are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons our
 brothers our neighbors our fellowcitizens what shadow of danger
 the mind nothing but frightful and distorted shapes gorgons hydras
 and chimeras dire discoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents
 and transforming everything it touches into a monster
a sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and
 improbable suggestions which have taken place respecting the power
 of calling for the services of the militia that of new hampshire
 undertake a distant and hopeless expedition for the purpose of
 riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen
 direct their course but to the seat of the tyrants who had
 meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project to crush them
 in their imagined intrenchments of power and to make them an
 example of the just vengeance of an abused and incensed people is
 against the violence of faction or sedition this was frequently
 the case in respect to the first object in the course of the late
 war and this mutual succor is indeed a principal end of our
 political association if the power of affording it be placed under
 the direction of the union there will be no danger of a supine and
 listless inattention to the dangers of a neighbor till its near
 jurisdiction of the union in respect to revenue must necessarily
 be empowered to extend it must embrace a provision for the support
 of the national civil list for the payment of the national debts
 contracted or that may be contracted and in general for all
 those matters which will call for disbursements out of the national
 treasury the conclusion is that there must be interwoven in the
 has no right to impose a new tax the consequence is that he
 permits the bashaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people
 without mercy and in turn squeezes out of them the sums of which
 he stands in need to satisfy his own exigencies and those of the
 state in america from a like cause the government of the union
 has gradually dwindled into a state of decay approaching nearly to
 means of furnishing the sums demanded but though this be strictly
 and truly the case though the assumption of such a right would be
 an infringement of the articles of union though it may seldom or
 never have been avowedly claimed yet in practice it has been
 constantly exercised and would continue to be so as long as the
 revenues of the confederacy should remain dependent on the
 embarrassments naturally resulting from defective supplies of the
 public treasury
the more intelligent adversaries of the new constitution admit
 the force of this reasoning but they qualify their admission by a
 distinction between what they call internal and external taxation
 the former they would reserve to the state governments the
 its present necessities its future necessities admit not of
 calculation or limitation and upon the principle more than once
 adverted to the power of making provision for them as they arise
 ought to be equally unconfined i believe it may be regarded as a
 position warranted by the history of mankind that in the usual
 progress of things the necessities of a nation in every stage of
 the states they will have proportionably less means to answer the
 demand if the opinions of those who contend for the distinction
 which has been mentioned were to be received as evidence of truth
 one would be led to conclude that there was some known point in the
 economy of national affairs at which it would be safe to stop and to
 say thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by
 debt and of a peace establishment for the union thus
 circumstanced a war breaks out what would be the probable conduct
 of the government in such an emergency taught by experience that
 proper dependence could not be placed on the success of
 requisitions unable by its own authority to lay hold of fresh
 resources and urged by considerations of national danger would it
 usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors with a
 sparing hand and at enormous premiums
it may perhaps be imagined that from the scantiness of the
 resources of the country the necessity of diverting the established
 funds in the case supposed would exist though the national
 government should possess an unrestrained power of taxation but
reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men who
 hope to see realized in america the halcyon scenes of the poetic or
 fabulous age but to those who believe we are likely to experience
 a common portion of the vicissitudes and calamities which have
 fallen to the lot of other nations they must appear entitled to
 serious attention such men must behold the actual situation of
 defect or disorder in the organs of perception or from the
 influence of some strong interest or passion or prejudice of
 this nature are the maxims in geometry that the whole is greater
 than its part things equal to the same are equal to one another
 two straight lines cannot enclose a space and all right angles
 are equal to each other of the same nature are these other
 abstruse paradoxes which however they may appear susceptible of
 demonstration are at variance with the natural conceptions which
 the mind without the aid of philosophy would be led to entertain
 upon the subject the infinite divisibility of matter or in other
 words the infinite divisibility of a finite thing extending even
 to the minutest atom is a point agreed among geometricians though
 give their own understandings fair play but yielding to some
 untoward bias they entangle themselves in words and confound
 themselves in subtleties
how else could it happen if we admit the objectors to be
 sincere in their opposition that positions so clear as those which
 manifest the necessity of a general power of taxation in the
 know no other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the
 resources of the community
as revenue is the essential engine by which the means of
 answering the national exigencies must be procured the power of
 procuring that article in its full extent must necessarily be
 comprehended in that of providing for those exigencies
 in substance to amount to this it is not true because the
 exigencies of the union may not be susceptible of limitation that
 its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined revenue is as
 requisite to the purposes of the local administrations as to those
 of the union and the former are at least of equal importance with
 the latter to the happiness of the people it is therefore as
 exclusion and destruction of the state governments
this mode of reasoning appears sometimes to turn upon the
 supposition of usurpation in the national government at other
 times it seems to be designed only as a deduction from the
 constitutional operation of its intended powers it is only in the
 latter light that it can be admitted to have any pretensions to
 with complete sovereignty in what does our security consist
 against usurpation from that quarter doubtless in the manner of
 their formation and in a due dependence of those who are to
 administer them upon the people if the proposed construction of
 the federal government be found upon an impartial examination of
 it to be such as to afford to a proper extent the same species of
 must be extremely vague and fallible and that it is by far the
 safest course to lay them altogether aside and to confine our
 attention wholly to the nature and extent of the powers as they are
 delineated in the constitution every thing beyond this must be
 left to the prudence and firmness of the people who as they will
 hold the scales in their own hands it is to be hoped will always
 governments from a power in the union to control them in the levies
 of money because i am persuaded that the sense of the people the
 extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the state
 governments and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local
 administrations for local purposes would be a complete barrier
 against the oppressive use of such a power yet i am willing here
 clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had
 and which were not by that act exclusively delegated to the united
 states this exclusive delegation or rather this alienation of
 state sovereignty would only exist in three cases where the
 constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the
 union where it granted in one instance an authority to the union
 clause of the same section empowers congress to lay and collect
 taxes duties imposts and excises and the second clause of the
 tenth section of the same article declares that no state shall
 without the consent of congress lay any imposts or duties on
 imports or exports except for the purpose of executing its
 inspection laws hence would result an exclusive power in the
 and in the individual states there is plainly no expression in the
 granting clause which makes that power exclusive in the union
 there is no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the
 states from exercising it so far is this from being the case that
 a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be deduced
 from the restraint laid upon the states in relation to duties on
 affirmance of another a negation of the authority of the states to
 impose taxes on imports and exports and an affirmance of their
 authority to impose them on all other articles it would be mere
 sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them absolutely from
 the imposition of taxes of the former kind and to leave them at
 liberty to lay others subject to the control of the national
 which would be requisite to work an exclusion of the states it is
 indeed possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by
 a state which might render it inexpedient that thus a further tax
 should be laid on the same article by the union but it would not
 imply a constitutional inability to impose a further tax the
 quantity of the imposition the expediency or inexpediency of an
 affirmative grants of general authorities there has been the most
 pointed care in those cases where it was deemed improper that the
 like authorities should reside in the states to insert negative
 clauses prohibiting the exercise of them by the states the tenth
 section of the first article consists altogether of such provisions
 this circumstance is a clear indication of the sense of the
 to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying
 into execution the powers by that constitution vested in the
 government of the united states or in any department or officer
 thereof and the second clause of the sixth article declares
 that the constitution and the laws of the united states made in
 pursuance thereof and the treaties made by their authority shall be
 necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of
 constituting a federal government and vesting it with certain
 specified powers this is so clear a proposition that moderation
 itself can scarcely listen to the railings which have been so
 copiously vented against this part of the plan without emotions
 that disturb its equanimity
 laying and collecting taxes had been previously given might in the
 execution of that power pass all laws necessary and proper to carry
 it into effect i have applied these observations thus particularly
 to the power of taxation because it is the immediate subject under
 consideration and because it is the most important of the
 authorities proposed to be conferred upon the union but the same
 most threatens our political welfare is that the state governments
 will finally sap the foundations of the union and might therefore
 think it necessary in so cardinal a point to leave nothing to
 construction whatever may have been the inducement to it the
 wisdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been
 raised against it as that very cry betrays a disposition to
 nature of the powers upon which it is founded suppose by some
 forced constructions of its authority which indeed cannot easily
 be imagined the federal legislature should attempt to vary the law
 of descent in any state would it not be evident that in making
 such an attempt it had exceeded its jurisdiction and infringed
 upon that of the state suppose again that upon the pretense of
 association if individuals enter into a state of society the laws
 of that society must be the supreme regulator of their conduct if
 a number of political societies enter into a larger political
 society the laws which the latter may enact pursuant to the powers
 intrusted to it by its constitution must necessarily be supreme
 over those societies and the individuals of whom they are composed
 understood though it had not been expressed
though a law therefore laying a tax for the use of the united
 states would be supreme in its nature and could not legally be
 opposed or controlled yet a law for abrogating or preventing the
 collection of a tax laid by the authority of the state unless upon
 imports and exports would not be the supreme law of the land but

 authority cannot exist is to set up supposition and theory against
 fact and reality however proper such reasonings might be to show
 that a thing ought not to exist they are wholly to be rejected when
 they are made use of to prove that it does not exist contrary to the
 evidence of the fact itself it is well known that in the roman
 republic the legislative authority in the last resort resided for
in the case particularly under consideration there is no such
 contradiction as appears in the example cited there is no power on
 either side to annul the acts of the other and in practice there
 is little reason to apprehend any inconvenience because in a
 short course of time the wants of the states will naturally reduce
 themselves within a very narrow compass and in the interim the
 fallacious than to infer the extent of any power proper to be
 lodged in the national government from an estimate of its immediate
 necessities there ought to be a capacity to provide for future
 contingencies as they may happen and as these are illimitable in
 their nature it is impossible safely to limit that capacity it is
 true perhaps that a computation might be made with sufficient
 as any that could be produced to establish the probable duration of
 the world observations confined to the mere prospects of internal
 attacks can deserve no weight though even these will admit of no
 satisfactory calculation but if we mean to be a commercial people
 it must form a part of our policy to be able one day to defend that
 commerce the support of a navy and of naval wars would involve
 us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to our
 option that however moderate or unambitious we may be we cannot
 count upon the moderation or hope to extinguish the ambition of
 others who could have imagined at the conclusion of the last war
 that france and britain wearied and exhausted as they both were
 would so soon have looked with so hostile an aspect upon each other

 almost all the objects of state expenditure are insignificant in
 comparison with those which relate to the national defense
in the kingdom of great britain where all the ostentatious
 apparatus of monarchy is to be provided for not above a fifteenth
 part of the annual income of the nation is appropriated to the class
but let us advert to the large debt which we have ourselves
 contracted in a single war and let us only calculate on a common
 share of the events which disturb the peace of nations and we shall
 instantly perceive without the aid of any elaborate illustration
 that there must always be an immense disproportion between the
 objects of federal and state expenditures it is true that several
 this view of the subject by what logic can it be maintained that
 the local governments ought to command in perpetuity an exclusive
 source of revenue for any sum beyond the extent of two hundred
 thousand pounds to extend its power further in exclusion of the
 authority of the union would be to take the resources of the
 community out of those hands which stood in need of them for the
 exclusive power of taxing houses and lands there would still be a
 great disproportion between the means and the end the possession
 of one third of the resources of the community to supply at most
 one tenth of its wants if any fund could have been selected and
 appropriated equal to and not greater than the object it would
 have been inadequate to the discharge of the existing debts of the
 important subject of taxation will claim a further consideration
publius
federalist no 
the same subject continued
concerning the general power of taxation
for the independent journal
 injurious excess there are persons who imagine that they can never
 be carried to too great a length since the higher they are the
 more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an extravagant
 consumption to produce a favorable balance of trade and to promote
 domestic manufactures but all extremes are pernicious in various
 ways exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a general
 exact proportion to every additional imposition laid upon it the
 merchant especially in a country of small commercial capital is
 often under a necessity of keeping prices down in order to a more
 expeditious sale
the maxim that the consumer is the payer is so much oftener
 true than the reverse of the proposition that it is far more
 states which are not in the same favorable situation they would
 not therefore in this mode alone contribute to the public treasury
 in a ratio to their abilities to make them do this it is necessary
 that recourse be had to excises the proper objects of which are
 particular kinds of manufactures new york is more deeply
 interested in these considerations than such of her citizens as
 precautions the first success would be apt to inspire false
 opinions which it might require a long course of subsequent
 experience to correct necessity especially in politics often
 occasions false hopes false reasonings and a system of measures
 correspondingly erroneous but even if this supposed excess should
 not be a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of
 another place the discussion of the question which relates to the
 sufficiency of the representative body in respect to numbers and
 shall content myself with examining here the particular use which
 has been made of a contrary supposition in reference to the
 immediate subject of our inquiries
the idea of an actual representation of all classes of the
 in a deliberative assembly the greatest natural abilities are for
 the most part useless and that the influence and weight and
 superior acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a
 contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the
 public councils unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading
 interests these considerations and many others that might be
 single acre every landholder will therefore have a common interest
 to keep the taxes on land as low as possible and common interest
 may always be reckoned upon as the surest bond of sympathy but if
 we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent
 landholder and the middling farmer what reason is there to
 conclude that the first would stand a better chance of being
 the case the representative body with too few exceptions to have
 any influence on the spirit of the government will be composed of
 landholders merchants and men of the learned professions but
 where is the danger that the interests and feelings of the different
 classes of citizens will not be understood or attended to by these
 three descriptions of men will not the landholder know and feel
 likely to be a competent judge of their nature extent and
 foundation than one whose observation does not travel beyond the
 circle of his neighbors and acquaintances is it not natural that a
 man who is a candidate for the favor of the people and who is
 dependent on the suffrages of his fellowcitizens for the
 continuance of his public honors should take care to inform himself
 the person in whose hands it should be acquainted with the general
 genius habits and modes of thinking of the people at large and
 with the resources of the country and this is all that can be
 reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and feelings of the
 people in any other sense the proposition has either no meaning
 or an absurd one and in that sense let every considerate citizen
 proprietors of land of merchants and of members of the learned
 professions who will truly represent all those different interests
 and views if it should be objected that we have seen other
 descriptions of men in the local legislatures i answer that it is
 admitted there are exceptions to the rule but not in sufficient
 number to influence the general complexion or character of the
 different branches of the mechanic or manufacturing arts as there
 are between any of the departments of labor and industry so that
 unless the representative body were to be far more numerous than
 would be consistent with any idea of regularity or wisdom in its
 deliberations it is impossible that what seems to be the spirit of
 the objection we have been considering should ever be realized in
 each state and is it not to be presumed that the men who will
 generally be sent there will be possessed of the necessary degree of
 intelligence to be able to communicate that information is the
 knowledge of local circumstances as applied to taxation a minute
 topographical acquaintance with all the mountains rivers streams
 highways and bypaths in each state or is it a general
the taxes intended to be comprised under the general
 denomination of internal taxes may be subdivided into those of the
 direct and those of the indirect kind though the objection be made
 to both yet the reasoning upon it seems to be confined to the
 former branch and indeed as to the latter by which must be
 understood duties and excises on articles of consumption one is at
 this view it will not bear a close examination land taxes are co
 monly laid in one of two modes either by actual valuations
 permanent or periodical or by occasional assessments at the
 discretion or according to the best judgment of certain officers
 whose duty it is to make them in either case the execution of the
 business which alone requires the knowledge of local details must
 federal government
let it be recollected that the proportion of these taxes is not
 to be left to the discretion of the national legislature but is to
 be determined by the numbers of each state as described in the
 second section of the first article an actual census or
 enumeration of the people must furnish the rule a circumstance
 to prove in theory or otherwise than by the experiment that it
 cannot be advantageously exercised the contrary indeed appears
 most probable the second answer is that the existence of such a
 power in the constitution will have a strong influence in giving
 efficacy to requisitions when the states know that the union can
 apply itself without their agency it will be a powerful motive for
 their most simple and most fit resource
many spectres have been raised out of this power of internal
 taxation to excite the apprehensions of the people double sets of
 revenue officers a duplication of their burdens by double
 taxations and the frightful forms of odious and oppressive
 polltaxes have been played off with all the ingenious dexterity of
 evils predicted to not necessarily result from the plan
as to any argument derived from a supposed system of influence
 it is a sufficient answer to say that it ought not to be presumed
 but the supposition is susceptible of a more precise answer if
 such a spirit should infest the councils of the union the most
 certain road to the accomplishment of its aim would be to employ the
 most convenient branch of revenue can be prudently improved to a
 much greater extent under federal than under state regulation and
 of course will render it less necessary to recur to more
 inconvenient methods and with this further advantage that as far
 as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of
 internal taxation it will impose a disposition to greater care in
 a power to lay them that they will actually be laid every state in
 the union has power to impose taxes of this kind and yet in
 several of them they are unknown in practice are the state
 governments to be stigmatized as tyrannies because they possess
 this power if they are not with what propriety can the like power
 justify such a charge against the national government or even be
 project that is calculated to disarm the government of a single
 weapon which in any possible contingency might be usefully employed
 for the general defense and security
i have now gone through the examination of such of the powers
 proposed to be vested in the united states which may be considered
 as having an immediate relation to the energy of the government
from the daily advertiser
friday january  
madison
to the people of the state of new york
in reviewing the defects of the existing confederation and
 showing that they cannot be supplied by a government of less energy
 apt to be diminished than promoted by those occasions which require
 an unusual exercise of it to those who have been led by experience
 to attend to this consideration it could not appear surprising
 that the act of the convention which recommends so many important
 changes and innovations which may be viewed in so many lights and
 relations and which touches the springs of so many passions and
 taken his bias from the weight of these considerations as well as
 from considerations of a sinister nature the predetermined
 adversary on the other hand can have been governed by no venial
 motive whatever the intentions of the first may be upright as
 they may on the contrary be culpable the views of the last cannot
 be upright and must be culpable but the truth is that these
 difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred
 to the convention
the novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us it has
 been shown in the course of these papers that the existing
 confederation is founded on principles which are fallacious that
 we must consequently change this first foundation and with it the
 imperfectly fulfilled the object of their appointment or the
 expectation of the public yet that it could not be easily
 accomplished will be denied by no one who is unwilling to betray
 his ignorance of the subject energy in government is essential to
 that security against external and internal danger and to that
 prompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the very
 but that those intrusted with it should be kept in independence on
 the people by a short duration of their appointments and that
 even during this short period the trust should be placed not in a
 few but a number of hands stability on the contrary requires
 that the hands in which power is lodged should continue for a length
 of time the same a frequent change of men will result from a
 most acute and metaphysical philosophers sense perception
 judgment desire volition memory imagination are found to be
 separated by such delicate shades and minute gradations that their
 boundaries have eluded the most subtle investigations and remain a
 pregnant source of ingenious disquisition and controversy the
 boundaries between the great kingdom of nature and still more
 and hopes from the efforts of human sagacity experience has
 instructed us that no skill in the science of government has yet
 been able to discriminate and define with sufficient certainty its
 three great provinces the legislative executive and judiciary or
 even the privileges and powers of the different legislative branches
 questions daily occur in the course of practice which prove the
 though penned with the greatest technical skill and passed on the
 fullest and most mature deliberation are considered as more or less
 obscure and equivocal until their meaning be liquidated and
 ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications
 besides the obscurity arising from the complexity of objects and
 the imperfection of the human faculties the medium through which
 cloudy medium through which it is communicated
here then are three sources of vague and incorrect
 definitions indistinctness of the object imperfection of the
 organ of conception inadequateness of the vehicle of ideas any
 one of these must produce a certain degree of obscurity the
 convention in delineating the boundary between the federal and
 which they had respectively obtained the greatest share of influence
 there are features in the constitution which warrant each of these
 suppositions and as far as either of them is well founded it
 shows that the convention must have been compelled to sacrifice
 theoretical propriety to the force of extraneous considerations
nor could it have been the large and small states only which
 deviations from that artificial structure and regular symmetry which
 an abstract view of the subject might lead an ingenious theorist to
 bestow on a constitution planned in his closet or in his
 imagination the real wonder is that so many difficulties should
 have been surmounted and surmounted with a unanimity almost as
 unprecedented as it must have been unexpected it is impossible for
 presented they serve only as exceptions to admonish us of the
 general truth and by their lustre to darken the gloom of the
 adverse prospect to which they are contrasted in revolving the
 causes from which these exceptions result and applying them to the
 particular instances before us we are necessarily led to two
 important conclusions the first is that the convention must have
to the people of the state of new york
it is not a little remarkable that in every case reported by
 ancient history in which government has been established with
 deliberation and consent the task of framing it has not been
 committed to an assembly of men but has been performed by some
 individual citizen of preeminent wisdom and approved integrity
 their respective establishments or how far they might be clothed
 with the legitimate authority of the people cannot in every
 instance be ascertained in some however the proceeding was
 strictly regular draco appears to have been intrusted by the
 people of athens with indefinite powers to reform its government and
 laws and solon according to plutarch was in a manner compelled
 themselves and their posterity than a select body of citizens from
 whose common deliberations more wisdom as well as more safety
 might have been expected these questions cannot be fully answered
 without supposing that the fears of discord and disunion among a
 number of counsellors exceeded the apprehension of treachery or
 incapacity in a single individual history informs us likewise of
is it an unreasonable conjecture that the errors which may be
 contained in the plan of the convention are such as have resulted
 rather from the defect of antecedent experience on this complicated
 and difficult subject than from a want of accuracy or care in the
 investigation of it and consequently such as will not be
 ascertained until an actual trial shall have pointed them out this
 persisted for several years in refusing her concurrence although
 the enemy remained the whole period at our gates or rather in the
 very bowels of our country nor was her pliancy in the end effected
 by a less motive than the fear of being chargeable with protracting
 the public calamities and endangering the event of the contest
 every candid reader will make the proper reflections on these
 prescription will be poison to his constitution and forbid him
 under pain of certain death to make use of it might not the
 patient reasonably demand before he ventured to follow this advice
 that the authors of it should at least agree among themselves on
 some other remedy to be substituted and if he found them differing
 as much from one another as from his first counsellors would he not
 a certain extent but by no means to the extent proposed a third
 does not object to the government over individuals or to the extent
 proposed but to the want of a bill of rights a fourth concurs in
 the absolute necessity of a bill of rights but contends that it
 ought to be declaratory not of the personal rights of individuals
 but of the rights reserved to the states in their political capacity
 imports is not less dissatisfied that the whole burden of taxes may
 be thrown on consumption this politician discovers in the
 constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy that
 is equally sure it will end in aristocracy another is puzzled to
 say which of these shapes it will ultimately assume but sees
 clearly it must be one or other of them whilst a fourth is not
 exclusion of the house of representatives whose numbers alone could
 be a due security against corruption and partiality in the exercise
 of such a power is equally obnoxious with another the admission
 of the president into any share of a power which ever must be a
 dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magistrate is an
 unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealousy no
 the president himself
as it can give no umbrage to the writers against the plan of the
 federal constitution let us suppose that as they are the most
 zealous so they are also the most sagacious of those who think the
 late convention were unequal to the task assigned them and that a
 wiser and better plan might and ought to be substituted let us
 until another should be agreed upon by this new assembly of
 lawgivers
it is a matter both of wonder and regret that those who raise
 so many objections against the new constitution should never call to
 mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it it is not
 necessary that the former should be perfect it is sufficient that
 troops dangerous the confederation gives to congress that power
 also and they have already begun to make use of it is it
 improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government
 in the same body of men congress a single body of men are the
 sole depositary of all the federal powers is it particularly
 dangerous to give the keys of the treasury and the command of the
 confederation is chargeable with the still greater folly of
 declaring certain powers in the federal government to be absolutely
 necessary and at the same time rendering them absolutely nugatory
 and in the next place that if the union is to continue and no
 better government be substituted effective powers must either be
 granted to or assumed by the existing congress in either of
 equity and generosity we may calculate therefore that a rich and
 fertile country of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the
 united states will soon become a national stock congress have
 assumed the administration of this stock they have begun to render
 it productive congress have undertaken to do more they have
 proceeded to form new states to erect temporary governments to
 impotency of that assembly
i mean not by any thing here said to throw censure on the
 measures which have been pursued by congress i am sensible they
 could not have done otherwise the public interest the necessity
 of the case imposed upon them the task of overleaping their
 constitutional limits but is not the fact an alarming proof of the
 evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of
 the people of america with the fundamental principles of the
 revolution or with that honorable determination which animates
 every votary of freedom to rest all our political experiments on
 the capacity of mankind for selfgovernment if the plan of the
 convention therefore be found to depart from the republican
 list of republics these examples which are nearly as dissimilar
 to each other as to a genuine republic show the extreme inaccuracy
 with which the term has been used in political disquisitions
if we resort for a criterion to the different principles on
 which different forms of government are established we may define a
 republic to be or at least may bestow that name on a government
 character according to the constitution of every state in the
 union some or other of the officers of government are appointed
 indirectly only by the people according to most of them the chief
 magistrate himself is so appointed and according to one this mode
 of appointment is extended to one of the coordinate branches of the
 legislature according to all the constitutions also the tenure
 most of the states even the judges with all other officers of the
 union will as in the several states be the choice though a
 remote choice of the people themselves the duration of the
 appointments is equally conformable to the republican standard and
 to the model of state constitutions the house of representatives is
 periodically elective as in all the states and for the period of
 the case and the example of the state constitutions
could any further proof be required of the republican complexion
 of this system the most decisive one might be found in its absolute
 prohibition of titles of nobility both under the federal and the
 state governments and in its express guaranty of the republican
 form to each of the latter
 authority
first in order to ascertain the real character of the
 government it may be considered in relation to the foundation on
 which it is to be established to the sources from which its
 ordinary powers are to be drawn to the operation of those powers
 to the extent of them and to the authority by which future
 obvious from this single consideration that it is to result neither
 from the decision of a majority of the people of the union nor from
 that of a majority of the states it must result from the unanimous
 assent of the several states that are parties to it differing no
 otherwise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed
 not by the legislative authority but by that of the people
 and the people will be represented in the same proportion and on
 the same principle as they are in the legislature of a particular
 state so far the government is national not federal the senate
 on the other hand will derive its powers from the states as
 political and coequal societies and these will be represented on
 the principle of equality in the senate as they now are in the
 in this that in the former the powers operate on the political
 bodies composing the confederacy in their political capacities in
 the latter on the individual citizens composing the nation in
 their individual capacities on trying the constitution by this
 criterion it falls under the national not the federal character
 though perhaps not so completely as has been understood in
 consolidated into one nation this supremacy is completely vested in
 the national legislature among communities united for particular
 purposes it is vested partly in the general and partly in the
 municipal legislatures in the former case all local authorities
 are subordinate to the supreme and may be controlled directed or
 abolished by it at pleasure in the latter the local or municipal
 established under the general rather than under the local
 governments or to speak more properly that it could be safely
 established under the first alone is a position not likely to be
 combated
if we try the constitution by its last relation to the authority
 by which amendments are to be made we find it neither wholly
 a national nor a federal constitution but a composition of both
 in its foundation it is federal not national in the sources from
 which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn it is partly
 federal and partly national in the operation of these powers it
 is national not federal in the extent of them again it is
 federal not national and finally in the authoritative mode of
either to the recommendation from the meeting at annapolis in
september  or to that from congress in february  it
will be sufficient to recur to these particular acts the act
from annapolis recommends the appointment of commissioners to
take into consideration the situation of the united states to
devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary
convention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing
in these states a firm national governmentresolved that in
the opinion of congress it is expedient that on the second
monday of may next a convention of delegates who shall have been
appointed by the several states be held at philadelphia for the
sole and express purpose of revising the articles of
former and confirmed by the latter from a comparison and fair
construction of these several modes of expression is to be
deduced the authority under which the convention acted they were
to frame a national government adequate to the exigencies of
government and of the union and to reduce the articles of
confederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes
scrupulous expositors of delegated powers let the most
inveterate objectors against those exercised by the convention
answer these questions let them declare whether it was of most
importance to the happiness of the people of america that the
articles of confederation should be disregarded and an adequate
government be provided and the union preserved or that an
the instrument are expressly authorized new provisions therein
are also expressly authorized here then is a power to change the
title to insert new articles to alter old ones must it of
necessity be admitted that this power is infringed so long as a
part of the old articles remain those who maintain the
affirmative ought at least to mark the boundary between
the legislatures not from the people of the states one branch
of the new government is to be appointed by these legislatures
and under the confederation the delegates to congress may all
be appointed immediately by the people and in two states are
actually so appointed do they require that the powers of the
government should act on the states and not immediately on
been so construed by congress as to levy a tribute immediately
from that source also but pretermitting these instances was it
not an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal
expectation of the people that the regulation of trade should be
submitted to the general government in such a form as would
render it an immediate source of general revenue had not
that these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify
all the charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it
and to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new
system the aspect of an entire transformation of the old in one
particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from
the tenor of their commission instead of reporting a plan
criticised the powers of the convention i dismiss it without
further observation the third point to be inquired into is how
far considerations of duty arising out of the case itself could
have supplied any defect of regular authority in the preceding
inquiries the powers of the convention have been analyzed and
tried with the same rigor and by the same rules as if they had
make so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the
errors of a system by which this crisis had been produced that
they were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a
reform as they have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect
the purposes of their appointment it could not be unknown to
them that the hopes and expectations of the great body of
warranted in the public estimation by occasions and objects
infinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to
be governed they must have reflected that in all great changes
of established governments forms ought to give way to substance
that a rigid adherence in such cases to the former would render
nominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the
little illtimed scruples no zeal for adhering to ordinary
forms were anywhere seen except in those who wished to indulge
under these masks their secret enmity to the substance contended
for they must have borne in mind that as the plan to be framed
and proposed was to be submitted to the people themselves the
disapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it
the uncertainties of delay and the hazard of events let me ask
the man who can raise his mind to one elevated conception who
can awaken in his bosom one patriotic emotion what judgment
ought to have been pronounced by the impartial world by the
friends of mankind by every virtuous citizen on the conduct and
character of this assembly or if there be a man whose
friends the prudent inquiry in all cases ought surely to be
not so much from whom the advice comes as whether the advice be
good the sum of what has been here advanced and proved is that
the charge against the convention of exceeding their powers
except in one instance little urged by the objectors has no
foundation to support it that if they had exceeded their powers
under two general points of view the first relates to the sum or
quantity of power which it vests in the government including
the restraints imposed on the states the second to the
particular structure of the government and the distribution of
this power among its several branches under the first view of
the subject two important questions arise  whether any part
of the writer it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and
declamation it may inflame the passions of the unthinking and
may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking but cool and
candid people will at once reflect that the purest of human
blessings must have a portion of alloy in them that the choice
must always be made if not of the lesser evil at least of the
 certain miscellaneous objects of general utility 
restraint of the states from certain injurious acts 
provisions for giving due efficacy to all these powers the
powers falling within the first class are those of declaring war
and granting letters of marque of providing armies and fleets
of regulating and calling forth the militia of levying and
seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such
a discussion in any place with what color of propriety could the
force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit
the force of offense if a federal constitution could chain the
ambition or set bounds to the exertions of all other nations
then indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own
establishments in the time of peace they were introduced by
charles vii of france all europe has followed or been forced
into the example had the example not been followed by other
nations all europe must long ago have worn the chains of a
universal monarch were every nation except france now to disband
its peace establishments the same event might follow the
liberties the clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on
the proposed constitution the union itself which it cements and
secures destroys every pretext for a military establishment
which could be dangerous america united with a handful of
troops or without a single soldier exhibits a more forbidding
posture to foreign ambition than america disunited with a
world the example will be followed here from the same motives
which produced universal imitation there instead of deriving
from our situation the precious advantage which great britain has
derived from hers the face of america will be but a copy of that
of the continent of europe it will present liberty everywhere
crushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes the fortunes
and be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it
next to the effectual establishment of the union the best
possible precaution against danger from standing armies is a
limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to
their support this precaution the constitution has prudently
added i will not repeat here the observations which i flatter
term had the argument from the british example been truly
stated it would have stood thus the term for which supplies
may be appropriated to the army establishment though unlimited
by the british constitution has nevertheless in practice been
limited by parliamentary discretion to a single year now if in
great britain where the house of commons is elected for seven
that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the people of
standing armies the attempt has awakened fully the public
attention to that important subject and has led to
investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal
conviction not only that the constitution has provided the most
effectual guards against danger from that quarter but that
situation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of
great britain the batteries most capable of repelling foreign
enterprises on our safety are happily such as can never be
turned by a perfidious government against our liberties the
inhabitants of the atlantic frontier are all of them deeply
interested in this provision for naval protection and if they
of its wealth lies every moment at the mercy of events and may
almost be regarded as a hostage for ignominious compliances with
the dictates of a foreign enemy or even with the rapacious
demands of pirates and barbarians should a war be the result of
the precarious situation of european affairs and all the unruly
passions attending it be let loose on the ocean our escape from
will address one additional reflection only to those who contend
that the power ought to have been restrained to external
taxation by which they mean taxes on articles imported from
other countries it cannot be doubted that this will always be a
valuable source of revenue that for a considerable time it must
be a principal source that at this moment it is an essential
government meant for duration ought to contemplate these
revolutions and be able to accommodate itself to them some
who have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation have
grounded a very fierce attack against the constitution on the
language in which it is defined it has been urged and echoed
that the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and
general welfare but what color can the objection have when a
specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms
immediately follows and is not even separated by a longer pause
than a semicolon if the different parts of the same instrument
ought to be so expounded as to give meaning to every part which
will bear it shall one part of the same sentence be excluded
used by the convention is a copy from the articles of
confederation the objects of the union among the states as
described in article third are their common defense security
of their liberties and mutual and general welfare  the terms
of article eighth are still more identical all charges of war
and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common
federalist no 
the powers conferred by the constitution further considered
from the new york packet tuesday january   
madison
to the people of the state of new york
the second class of powers lodged in the general government
exception under which treaties might be substantially frustrated
by regulations of the states and that a power of appointing and
receiving other public ministers and consuls is expressly
and very properly added to the former provision concerning
ambassadors the term ambassador if taken strictly as seems to
be required by the second of the articles of confederation
consuls into the united states where no previous treaty has
stipulated it seems to have been nowhere provided for a supply
of the omission is one of the lesser instances in which the
convention have improved on the model before them but the most
minute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the
necessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations
articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no
further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of
these offenses the definition of piracies might perhaps
without inconveniency be left to the law of nations though a
legislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes
a definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently
submitted to the federal administration it were doubtless to be
wished that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves
had not been postponed until the year  or rather that it had
been suffered to have immediate operation but it is not
difficult to account either for this restriction on the general
government or for the manner in which the whole clause is
europe to america i mention these misconstructions not with a
view to give them an answer for they deserve none but as
specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit
to conduct their opposition to the proposed government the
powers included in the third class are those which provide for
the harmony and proper intercourse among the states under this
post offices and post roads the defect of power in the existing
confederacy to regulate the commerce between its several members
is in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out by
experience to the proofs and remarks which former papers have
brought into view on this subject it may be added that without
this supplemental provision the great and essential power of
states to collect in any form an indirect revenue from their
uncommercial neighbors must appear not less impolitic than it is
unfair since it would stimulate the injured party by resentment
as well as interest to resort to less convenient channels for
their foreign trade but the mild voice of reason pleading the
cause of an enlarged and permanent interest is but too often
netherlands on its members one is that they shall not establish
imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors without the general
permission the regulation of commerce with the indian tribes is
very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of
confederation which render the provision obscure and
contradictory the power is there restrained to indians not
coin is that by providing for this last case the constitution
has supplied a material omission in the articles of
confederation the authority of the existing congress is
restrained to the regulation of coin struck by their own
authority or that of the respective states it must be seen at
once that the proposed uniformity in the value of the current
commerce etc there is a confusion of language here which is
remarkable why the terms free inhabitants are used in one part
of the article free citizens in another and people in another
or what was meant by superadding to all privileges and
immunities of free citizens all the privileges of trade and
commerce 
aliens in every other state in one state residence for a short
term confirms all the rights of citizenship in another
qualifications of greater importance are required an alien
therefore legally incapacitated for certain rights in the
latter may by previous residence only in the former elude his
incapacity and thus the law of one state be preposterously
from the defect of the confederation on this head by authorizing
the general government to establish a uniform rule of
naturalization throughout the united states the power of

all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding ten miles
square as may by cession of particular states and the
acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the
united states and to exercise like authority over all places
purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the states in
public pledge to be left in the hands of a single state and
would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government as
still further to abridge its necessary independence the extent
of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy
every jealousy of an opposite nature and as it is to be
appropriated to this use with the consent of the state ceding it
exempt from the authority of the particular state nor would it
be proper for the places on which the security of the entire
union may depend to be in any degree dependent on a particular

such establishment  to declare the punishment of treason

colonies by which were evidently meant the other british
united states with a proviso that nothing in the constitution

states or of any particular state this is a power of very
great importance and required by considerations similar to those
which show the propriety of the former the proviso annexed is

deposited by the constitution governments of dissimilar
principles and forms have been found less adapted to a federal
coalition of any sort than those of a kindred nature as the
confederate republic of germany says montesquieu consists

experience shows us that it is more imperfect than that of
answered that if the general government should interpose by
virtue of this constitutional authority it will be of course
bound to pursue the authority but the authority extends no
further than to a guaranty of a republican form of government
which supposes a preexisting government of the form which is to
be guaranteed as long therefore as the existing republican

speaking are not under one government provision is made for

insurrections in a state will rarely induce a federal
interposition unless the number concerned in them bear some
proportion to the friends of government it will be much better

superintending power than that the majority should be left to
become a majority of persons by the accession of alien
residents of a casual concourse of adventurers or of those whom
the constitution of the state has not admitted to the rights of
suffrage i take no notice of an unhappy species of population

no possible constitution can provide a cure among the
advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by montesquieu
an important one is that should a popular insurrection happen
which usually characterizes little critics the omission has been
transformed and magnified into a plot against the national
rights the authors of this discovery may be told what few
others need to be informed of that as engagements are in their
nature reciprocal an assertion of their validity on one side
necessarily involves a validity on the other side and that as
discovered faults it moreover equally enables the general and
the state governments to originate the amendment of errors as
they may be pointed out by the experience on one side or on the
other the exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the
senate was probably meant as a palladium to the residuary
sovereignty of the states implied and secured by that principle
confederation which stands in the solemn form of a compact among
the states can be superseded without the unanimous consent of
the parties to it  what relation is to subsist between the
nine or more states ratifying the constitution and the remaining
few who do not become parties to it the first question is
answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the
mutually conditions of each other that a breach of any one
article is a breach of the whole treaty and that a breach
committed by either of the parties absolves the others and
authorizes them if they please to pronounce the compact
violated and void should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to
these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with

powers vested by this constitution in the government of the
united states or in any department or officer thereof few
parts of the constitution have been assailed with more
intemperance than this yet on a fair investigation of it no
part can appear more completely invulnerable without the
first method of adopting the second article of confederation it
is evident that the new congress would be continually exposed as
their predecessors have been to the alternative of construing
the term expressly with so much rigor as to disarm the
government of all real authority whatever or with so much
latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction
may produce for in every new application of a general power the
particular powers which are the means of attaining the object of
the general power must always necessarily vary with that object
and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same
had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means
not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into

is more clearly established in law or in reason than that
wherever the end is required the means are authorized wherever
a general power to do a thing is given every particular power
necessary for doing it is included had this last method
therefore been pursued by the convention every objection now
the election of more faithful representatives annul the acts of
the usurpers the truth is that this ultimate redress may be
more confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal
than of the state legislatures for this plain reason that as
every such act of the former will be an invasion of the rights of
the latter these will be ever ready to mark the innovation to
a moment that the supremacy of the state constitutions had been
left complete by a saving clause in their favor in the first
place as these constitutions invest the state legislatures with
absolute sovereignty in all cases not excepted by the existing
articles of confederation all the authorities contained in the
proposed constitution so far as they exceed those enumerated in
authority of the whole society every where subordinate to the
authority of the parts it would have seen a monster in which
the head was under the direction of the members  the
senators and representatives and the members of the several
state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both
of the united states and the several states shall be bound by
the officers and according to the laws of the states  among
the provisions for giving efficacy to the federal powers might be
added those which belong to the executive and judiciary
departments but as these are reserved for particular examination
in another place i pass them over in this we have now
reviewed in detail all the articles composing the sum or
having shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal
government is unnecessary or improper the next question to be
considered is whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous
to the portion of authority left in the several states the
adversaries to the plan of the convention instead of considering
in the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary
states was then the american revolution effected was the
american confederacy formed was the precious blood of thousands
spilt and the hardearned substance of millions lavished not
that the people of america should enjoy peace liberty and
safety but that the government of the individual states that
particular municipal establishments might enjoy a certain extent
happiness of the people the voice of every good citizen must be
let the former be sacrificed to the latter how far the sacrifice
is necessary has been shown how far the unsacrificed residue
will be endangered is the question before us several important
considerations have been touched in the course of these papers
which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the
degree and species of power which gave it a considerable
likeness to the government framed by the convention the lycian
confederacy as far as its principles and form are transmitted
must have borne a still greater analogy to it yet history does
not inform us that either of them ever degenerated or tended to
degenerate into one consolidated government on the contrary we
possessed the affections of the people the great kingdoms in
europe would at this time consist of as many independent princes
as there were formerly feudatory barons the state government
will have the advantage of the federal government whether we
compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on
the other to the weight of personal influence which each side
election into the state legislatures thus each of the principal
branches of the federal government will owe its existence more or
less to the favor of the state governments and must consequently
feel a dependence which is much more likely to beget a
disposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards them on
the other side the component parts of the state governments will
three great departments of the thirteen states excluding from
the judiciary department the justices of peace with the members
of the corresponding departments of the single government of the
union compare the militia officers of three millions of people
with the military and marine officers of any establishment which
is within the compass of probability or i may add of
rules appointed by the several states indeed it is extremely
probable that in other instances particularly in the
organization of the judicial power the officers of the states
will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the union
should it happen however that separate collectors of internal
revenue should be appointed under the federal government the
the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state the
operations of the federal government will be most extensive and
important in times of war and danger those of the state
governments in times of peace and security as the former
periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter the
state governments will here enjoy another advantage over the
regarded as the most important and yet the present congress have
as complete authority to require of the states indefinite
supplies of money for the common defense and general welfare as
the future congress will have to require them of individual
citizens and the latter will be no more bound than the states
themselves have been to pay the quotas respectively taxed on
resuming the subject of the last paper i proceed to inquire
whether the federal government or the state governments will have
the advantage with regard to the predilection and support of the
people notwithstanding the different modes in which they are
appointed we must consider both of them as substantially
dependent on the great body of the citizens of the united states
other truth no less than decency requires that the event in
every case should be supposed to depend on the sentiments and
sanction of their common constituents many considerations
besides those suggested on a former occasion seem to place it
beyond doubt that the first and most natural attachment of the
people will be to the governments of their respective states
great as it can well have in any future circumstances whatever
it was engaged too in a course of measures which had for their
object the protection of everything that was dear and the
acquisition of everything that could be desirable to the people
at large it was nevertheless invariably found after the
transient enthusiasm for the early congresses was over that the
nature of things be advantageously administered the remaining
points on which i propose to compare the federal and state
governments are the disposition and the faculty they may
respectively possess to resist and frustrate the measures of
each other it has been already proved that the members of the
federal will be more dependent on the members of the state
of the errors committed by the state legislatures proceeds from
the disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and
permanent interest of the state to the particular and separate
views of the counties or districts in which they reside and if
they do not sufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the
collective welfare of their particular state how can it be
have but too frequently displayed the character rather of
partisans of their respective states than of impartial guardians
of a common interest that where on one occasion improper
sacrifices have been made of local considerations to the
aggrandizement of the federal government the great interests of
the nation have suffered on a hundred from an undue attention to
particular state though unfriendly to the national government
be generally popular in that state and should not too grossly
violate the oaths of the state officers it is executed
immediately and of course by means on the spot and depending on
the state alone the opposition of the federal government or the
interposition of federal officers would but inflame the zeal of
obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing
to encounter but ambitious encroachments of the federal
government on the authority of the state governments would not
excite the opposition of a single state or of a few states
only they would be signals of general alarm every government
would espouse the common cause a correspondence would be
contending against thirteen sets of representatives with the
whole body of their common constituents on the side of the
latter the only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall
of the state governments is the visionary supposition that the
federal government may previously accumulate a military force for
the projects of ambition the reasonings contained in these
formed and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal
government still it would not be going too far to say that the
state governments with the people on their side would be able
to repel the danger the highest number to which according to
the best computation a standing army can be carried in any
country does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number
which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against
the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a
simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the
military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe which
are carried as far as the public resources will bear the
governments are afraid to trust the people with arms and it is
by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious
measures which must precede and produce it the argument under
the present head may be put into a very concise form which
appears altogether conclusive either the mode in which the
federal government is to be constructed will render it
sufficiently dependent on the people or it will not on the
the particular structure of the new government and the
distribution of power among its different parts

having reviewed the general form of the proposed government and
patrons of liberty than that on which the objection is founded

judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and
whether hereditary selfappointed or elective may justly be
pronounced the very definition of tyranny were the federal
constitution therefore really chargeable with the accumulation
constitution was to montesquieu what homer has been to the
didactic writers on epic poetry as the latter have considered
the work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the
principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn and by
which all similar works were to be judged so this great
political critic appears to have viewed the constitution of
houses of parliament and form when he pleases to consult them
one of his constitutional councils one branch of the legislative
department forms also a great constitutional council to the
executive chief as on another hand it is the sole depositary
of judicial power in cases of impeachment and is invested with
the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases the
would have been the case in the constitution examined by him if
the king who is the sole executive magistrate had possessed
also the complete legislative power or the supreme
administration of justice or if the entire legislative body had
possessed the supreme judiciary or the supreme executive
authority this however is not among the vices of that
montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his
meaning when the legislative and executive powers are united
in the same person or body says he there can be no liberty
because apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or senate
should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical
manner  again were the power of judging joined with the
avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments and has
qualified the doctrine by declaring that the legislative
executive and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate
from and independent of each other as the nature of a free
government will admit or as is consistent with that chain of
connection that binds the whole fabric of the constitution in one
legislative department shall never exercise the executive and
judicial powers or either of them the executive shall never
exercise the legislative and judicial powers or either of them
the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive
powers or either of them  this declaration corresponds
precisely with the doctrine of montesquieu as it has been
this last point at least violated the rule established by
themselves i pass over the constitutions of rhode island and
connecticut because they were formed prior to the revolution
and even before the principle under examination had become an
object of political attention the constitution of new york
contains no declaration on this subject but appears very
ordinary or surrogate of the state is a member of the supreme
court of appeals and president with a casting vote of one of
the legislative branches the same legislative branch acts again
as executive council of the governor and with him constitutes
the court of appeals the members of the judiciary department are
appointed by the legislative department and removable by one
appointed three by each of the legislative branches constitutes
the supreme court of appeals he is joined with the legislative
department in the appointment of the other judges throughout the
states it appears that the members of the legislature may at the
same time be justices of the peace in this state the members of
one branch of it are exofficio justices of the peace as are
the same time except that the justices of county courts shall be
eligible to either house of assembly  yet we find not only
this express exception with respect to the members of the
irferior courts but that the chief magistrate with his
executive council are appointable by the legislature that two
members of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure
in the constitution of georgia where it is declared that the
legislative executive and judiciary departments shall be
separate and distinct so that neither exercise the powers
properly belonging to the other we find that the executive
department is to be filled by appointments of the legislature
and the executive prerogative of pardon to be finally exercised
violating the sacred maxim of free government is warranted
neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author
nor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in
america this interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing

administered by either of the other departments it is equally
evident that none of them ought to possess directly or
indirectly an overruling influence over the others in the
administration of their respective powers it will not be denied
that power is of an encroaching nature and that it ought to be
effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it
the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its
impetuous vortex the founders of our republics have so much
merit for the wisdom which they have displayed that no task can
be less pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which
they have fallen a respect for truth however obliges us to
remark that they seem never for a moment to have turned their
favorable emergency to start up in the same quarter but in a
representative republic where the executive magistracy is
carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of its
power and where the legislative power is exercised by an
assembly which is inspired by a supposed influence over the
people with an intrepid confidence in its own strength which is
simple in its nature and the judiciary being described by
landmarks still less uncertain projects of usurpation by either
of these departments would immediately betray and defeat
themselves nor is this all as the legislative department alone
has access to the pockets of the people and has in some
constitutions full discretion and in all a prevailing influence
to be intermixed the authority in support of it is mr
jefferson who besides his other advantages for remarking the
operation of the government was himself the chief magistrate of
it in order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience
had impressed him on this subject it will be necessary to quote
a passage of some length from his very interesting notes on the
government laid its foundation on this basis that the
legislative executive and judiciary departments should be
separate and distinct so that no person should exercise the
powers of more than one of them at the same time but no barrier
was provided between these several powers the judiciary and the
executive members were left dependent on the legislative for
executive branches of government had performed their duty as
guardians of the people or assumed to themselves or exercised
other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the
constitution  in the execution of this trust the council were
necessarily led to a comparison of both the legislative and
executive proceedings with the constitutional powers of these
determination those who wish to see the several particulars
falling under each of these heads may consult the journals of
the council which are in print some of them it will be found
may be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected with the
war but the greater part of them may be considered as the
spontaneous shoots of an illconstituted government it appears
course be more freely hazarded than where the executive
department is administered by a single hand or by a few hands
the conclusion which i am warranted in drawing from these
observations is that a mere demarcation on parchment of the
constitutional limits of the several departments is not a
sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a
a turn of thinking original comprehensive and accurate and is
the more worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent
attachment to republican government and an enlightened view of
the dangerous propensities against which it ought to be guarded
one of the precautions which he proposes and on which he appears
ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of
the chartered authorities of the others the several departments
being perfectly coordinate by the terms of their common
commission none of them it is evident can pretend to an
exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between
their respective powers and how are the encroachments of the
stronger to be prevented or the wrongs of the weaker to be
derive no advantage from its remedial provision i do not dwell
however on this objection because it may be thought to be
rather against the modification of the principle than against
the principle itself in the next place it may be considered as
an objection inherent in the principle that as every appeal to
the people would carry an implication of some defect in the
reason but a nation of philosophers is as little to be expected
as the philosophical race of kings wished for by plato and in
every other nation the most rational government will not find it
a superfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community
on its side the danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by
interesting too strongly the public passions is a still more
be reformed could mingle its leaven in the operation the future
situations in which we must expect to be usually placed do not
present any equivalent security against the danger which is
apprehended but the greatest objection of all is that the
decisions which would probably result from such appeals would not
answer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional equilibrium
among the people at large their connections of blood of
friendship and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the
most influential part of the society the nature of their public
trust implies a personal influence among the people and that
they are more immediately the confidential guardians of the
rights and liberties of the people with these advantages it can
usurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so
sudden as to admit of no specious coloring a strong party
among themselves might take side with the other branches the
executive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of
the people in such a posture of things the public decision
might be less swayed by prepossessions in favor of the
effectual provision for that purpose how far the provisions of a
different nature contained in the plan above quoted might be
adequate i do not examine some of them are unquestionably
founded on sound political principles and all of them are framed

if the periods be separated by short intervals the measures to
be reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date and will
be connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and
pervert the result of occasional revisions if the periods be
distant from each other the same remark will be applicable to
all recent measures and in proportion as the remoteness of the
scheme of revising the constitution in order to correct recent
breaches of it as well as for other purposes has been actually
tried in one of the states one of the objects of the council of
censors which met in pennsylvania in  and  was as we
have seen to inquire whether the constitution had been
violated and whether the legislative and executive departments
be thus brought to the test of the constitution two of the
members had been vicepresidents of the state and several other
members of the executive council within the seven preceding
years one of them had been speaker and a number of others
distinguished members of the legislative assembly within the
same period thirdly every page of their proceedings witnesses
opinions if they are so to be called will be the same
fourthly it is at least problematical whether the decisions of
this body do not in several instances misconstrue the limits
prescribed for the legislative and executive departments instead
of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places
fifthly i have never understood that the decisions of the
nor desired because an extinction of parties necessarily implies
either a universal alarm for the public safety or an absolute
extinction of liberty were the precaution taken of excluding
from the assemblies elected by the people to revise the
preceding administration of the government all persons who
should have been concerned with the government within the given
in practice the necessary partition of power among the several
departments as laid down in the constitution the only answer
that can be given is that as all these exterior provisions are
found to be inadequate the defect must be supplied by so
contriving the interior structure of the government as that its
several constituent parts may by their mutual relations be the
same fountain of authority the people through channels having
no communication whatever with one another perhaps such a plan
of constructing the several departments would be less difficult
in practice than it may in contemplation appear some
difficulties however and some additional expense would attend
the execution of it some deviations therefore from the
powers in the same department consists in giving to those who
administer each department the necessary constitutional means and
personal motives to resist encroachments of the others the
provision for defense must in this as in all other cases be
made commensurate to the danger of attack ambition must be made
to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be
well as public we see it particularly displayed in all the
subordinate distributions of power where the constant aim is to
divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that
each may be a check on the other that the private interest of
every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights these
inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the
be armed but perhaps it would be neither altogether safe nor
alone sufficient on ordinary occasions it might not be exerted
with the requisite firmness and on extraordinary occasions it
might be perfidiously abused may not this defect of an absolute
negative be supplied by some qualified connection between this
weaker department and the weaker branch of the stronger
the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two
distinct governments and then the portion allotted to each
subdivided among distinct and separate departments hence a
double security arises to the rights of the people the different
governments will control each other at the same time that each
will be controlled by itself second it is of great importance
as the rightful interests of the minor party and may possibly be
turned against both parties the second method will be
exemplified in the federal republic of the united states whilst
all authority in it will be derived from and dependent on the
society the society itself will be broken into so many parts
interests and classes of citizens that the rights of
every class of citizens will be diminished and consequently the
stability and independence of some member of the government the
only other security must be proportionately increased justice

from the more general inquiries pursued in the four last papers
i pass on to a more particular examination of the several parts
of the government i shall begin with the house of
representatives the first view to be taken of this part of the
dissatisfactory to some of the states as it would have been
difficult to the convention the provision made by the convention
appears therefore to be the best that lay within their option
it must be satisfactory to every state because it is conformable
to the standard already established or which may be established
by the state itself it will be safe to the united states
whether native or adoptive whether young or old and without
regard to poverty or wealth or to any particular profession of
religious faith the term for which the representatives are to be
elected falls under a second view which may be taken of this
branch in order to decide on the propriety of this article two
questions must be considered first whether biennial elections
polity it is in more modern times only that we are to expect
instructive examples and even here in order to avoid a research
too vague and diffusive it will be proper to confine ourselves
to the few examples which are best known and which bear the
greatest analogy to our particular case the first to which this
character ought to be applied is the house of commons in great
held frequently by another statute which passed a few years
later in the same reign the term frequently which had
alluded to the triennial period settled in the time of charles
ii  is reduced to a precise meaning it being expressly enacted
that a new parliament shall be called within three years after
the termination of the former the last change from three to
entirely by the discretion of the crown and were seldom
repeated except on the accession of a new prince or some other
contingent event the parliament which commenced with george ii
was continued throughout his whole reign a period of about
thirtyfive years the only dependence of the representatives on
the people consisted in the right of the latter to supply
representatives and themselves let us bring our inquiries nearer
home the example of these states when british colonies claims
particular attention at the same time that it is so well known
as to require little to be said on it the principle of
representation in one branch of the legislature at least was
established in all of them but the periods of election were
elections under the former government were septennial this
particular example is brought into view not as a proof of any
peculiar merit for the priority in those instances was probably
accidental and still less of any advantage in septennial
elections for when compared with a greater frequency they are
inadmissible but merely as a proof and i conceive it to be a
and controlled by the several collateral legislatures which
other legislative bodies are not and in the third place no
comparison can be made between the means that will be possessed
by the more permanent branches of the federal government for
seducing if they should be disposed to seduce the house of
representatives from their duty to the people and the means of
proof beyond the case before us what is the reason on which this
proverbial observation is founded no man will subject himself to
the ridicule of pretending that any natural connection subsists
between the sun or the seasons and the period within which human
virtue can bear the temptations of power happily for mankind
liberty is not in this respect confined to any single point of
longest and shortest periods and yet it would be not easy to
show that connecticut or rhode island is better governed or
enjoys a greater share of rational liberty than south carolina
or that either the one or the other of these states is
distinguished in these respects and by these causes from the
states whose elections are different from both in searching for
instances actually changed by legislative acts some of the
most fundamental articles of the government they have in
particular on several occasions changed the period of election
and on the last occasion not only introduced septennial in
place of triennial elections but by the same act continued
themselves in place four years beyond the term for which they
inculcated by a laudable zeal to erect some barrier against the
gradual innovations of an unlimited government that the advance
towards tyranny was to be calculated by the distance of departure
from the fixed point of annual elections but what necessity can
there be of applying this expedient to a government limited as
the federal government will be by the authority of a paramount
be attained or at least thoroughly attained by actual
experience in the station which requires the use of it the
period of service ought therefore in all such cases to bear
some proportion to the extent of practical knowledge requisite to
the due performance of the service the period of legislative
service established in most of the states for the more numerous
extensive region and are extremely diversified by t e local
affairs connected with them and can with difficulty be correctly
learnt in any other place than in the central councils to which a
knowledge of them will be brought by the representatives of every
part of the empire yet some knowledge of the affairs and even
of the laws of all the states ought to be possessed by the
proportional degree of information with regard to them it is
true that all these difficulties will by degrees be very much
diminished the most laborious task will be the proper
inauguration of the government and the primeval formation of a
federal code improvements on the first draughts will every year
become both easier and fewer past transactions of the
and other nations but also with the commercial policy and laws
of other nations he ought not to be altogether ignorant of the
law of nations for that as far as it is a proper object of
municipal legislation is submitted to the federal government
and although the house of representatives is not immediately to
participate in foreign negotiations and arrangements yet from
drawn on this subject from the case of the delegates to the
existing congress they are elected annually it is true but
their reelection is considered by the legislative assemblies
almost as a matter of course the election of the representatives
by the people would not be governed by the same principle a few
of the members as happens in all such assemblies will possess
purposes hence a very pernicious encouragement is given to the
use of unlawful means for obtaining irregular returns were
elections for the federal legislature to be annual this practice
might become a very serious abuse particularly in the more
distant states each house is as it necessarily must be the
judge of the elections qualifications and returns of its
the next view which i shall take of the house of representatives
relates to the appointment of its members to the several states
which is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct
taxes                                                           
           it is not contended that the number of people in each
state ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion
of representation or of slaves combined with free citizens as a
ratio of taxation that slaves ought to be included in the
numerical rule of representation slaves are considered as
property not as persons they ought therefore to be comprehended
in estimates of taxation which are founded on property and to be
excluded from representation which is regulated by a census of
slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank and classed
with those irrational animals which fall under the legal
denomination of property in being protected on the other hand
in his life and in his limbs against the violence of all
others even the master of his labor and his liberty and in
being punishable himself for all violence committed against
sides that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation as
they are the only proper scale of representation would the
convention have been impartial or consistent if they had
rejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants when the shares
of representation were to be calculated and inserted them on the
lists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted could
rejecting them altogether the constitution would in this
respect have followed the very laws which have been appealed to
as the proper guide this objection is repelled by a single
abservation it is a fundamental principle of the proposed
constitution that as the aggregate number of representatives
allotted to the several states is to be determined by a federal
manner with other inhabitants who by the policy of other
states are not admitted to all the rights of citizens a
rigorous adherence however to this principle is waived by
those who would be gainers by it all that they ask is that
equal moderation be shown on the other side let the case of the
slaves be considered as it is in truth a peculiar one let the
part of the society which is most interested in this object of
government in the federal constitution this policy does not
prevail the rights of property are committed into the same hands
with the personal rights some attention ought therefore to be
paid to property in the choice of those hands for another
reason the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the
superior number alone as far therefore as their superior
wealth and weight may justly entitle them to any advantage it
ought to be secured to them by a superior share of
representation the new constitution is in this respect
materially different from the existing confederation as well as
from that of the united netherlands and other similar
difference in the case it proceeds from the difference in the
personal character of the individual representative rather than
from any regard to the extent of the district from which he
comes such is the reasoning which an advocate for the
southern interests might employ on this subject and although it
may appear to be a little strained in some points yet on the

the total number of the house of representatives

hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
the number of which the house of representatives is to consist
people and the obstacles which will prevent a correspondent
increase of the representatives in general it may be remarked on
this subject that no political problem is less susceptible of a
precise solution than that which relates to the number most
convenient for a representative legislature nor is there any
point on which the policy of the several states is more at
four or five thousand in rhode island they bear a proportion of
at least one for every thousand and according to the
constitution of georgia the proportion may be carried to one to
every ten electors and must unavoidably far exceed the
proportion in any of the other states another general remark to
be made is that the ratio between the representatives and the
benefits of free consultation and discussion and to guard
against too easy a combination for improper purposes as on the
other hand the number ought at most to be kept within a certain
limit in order to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a
multitude in all very numerous assemblies of whatever character
composed passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason
legislature is to consist at the outset of the government will
be sixtyfive within three years a census is to be taken when
the number may be augmented to one for every thirty thousand
inhabitants and within every successive period of ten years the
census is to be renewed and augmentations may continue to be
made under the above limitation it will not be thought an
true question to be decided then is whether the smallness of the
number as a temporary regulation be dangerous to the public
liberty whether sixtyfive members for a few years and a
hundred or two hundred for a few more be a safe depositary for a
limited and wellguarded power of legislating for the united
states i must own that i could not give a negative answer to
time in the united states any sixtyfive or a hundred men
capable of recommending themselves to the choice of the people at
large who would either desire or dare within the short space of
two years to betray the solemn trust committed to them what
change of circumstances time and a fuller population of our
country may produce requires a prophetic spirit to declare
they held their consultations always under the veil of secrecy
they had the sole transaction of our affairs with foreign
nations through the whole course of the war they had the fate of
their country more in their hands than it is to be hoped will
ever be the case with our future representatives and from the
greatness of the prize at stake and the eagerness of the party
is to be exhausted by the president in subduing the virtue of the
senate now the fidelity of the other house is to be the
victim the improbability of such a mercenary and perfidious
combination of the several members of government standing on as
different foundations as republican principles will well admit
and at the same time accountable to the society over which they
circumspection and distrust so there are other qualities in
human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and
confidence republican government presupposes the existence of
these qualities in a higher degree than any other form were the
pictures which have been drawn by the political jealousy of some
among us faithful likenesses of the human character the
inhabitants and the diversity of their interests without taking
into view at the same time the circumstances which will
distinguish the congress from other legislative bodies the best
answer that can be given to it will be a brief explanation of
these peculiarities it is a sound and important principle that
the representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and
representatives would be very sufficient vehicles of it to the
federal councils taxation will consist in a great measure of
duties which will be involved in the regulation of commerce so
far the preceding remark is applicable to this object as far as
it may consist of internal collections a more diffusive
knowledge of the circumstances of the state may be necessary but
internal taxes may be necessary and particularly in cases
requiring uniformity throughout the states the more simple
objects will be preferred to be fully sensible of the facility
which will be given to this branch of federal legislation by the
assistance of the state codes we need only suppose for a moment
that this or any other state were divided into a number of parts
the militia for however different the rules of discipline may be
in different states they are the same throughout each particular
state and depend on circumstances which can differ but little in
different parts of the same state the attentive reader will
discern that the reasoning here used to prove the sufficiency of
a moderate number of representatives does not in any respect
laws and in many other circumstances connected with the objects
of federal legislation with all of which the federal
representatives ought to have some acquaintance whilst a few
representatives therefore from each state may bring with them
a due knowledge of their own state every representative will
have much information to acquire concerning all the other states
course of these inquiries corroborates the result of the
reflections which we have just made the number of inhabitants in
the two kingdoms of england and scotland cannot be stated at less
than eight millions the representatives of these eight millions
in the house of commons amount to five hundred and fiftyeight
of this number one ninth are elected by three hundred and
knowledge of their affairs with all these concessions two
hundred and seventynine persons only will be the depository of
the safety interest and happiness of eight millions that is to
say there will be one representative only to maintain the rights
and explain the situation of twentyeight thousand six hundred
and seventy constitutents in an assembly exposed to the whole
the alleged tendency of the new plan to elevate the few at the
expense of the many considered in connection with representation

to the people of the state of new york
the third charge against the house of representatives is that it
preventing their degeneracy are numerous and various the most
effectual one is such a limitation of the term of appointments
as will maintain a proper responsibility to the people let me
now ask what circumstance there is in the constitution of the
house of representatives that violates the principles of
republican government or favors the elevation of the few on the
of the people if we consider the situation of the men on whom
the free suffrages of their fellowcitizens may confer the
representative trust we shall find it involving every security
which can be devised or desired for their fidelity to their
constituents in the first place as they will have been
distinguished by the preference of their fellowcitizens we are
his constituents are strengthened by motives of a more selfish
nature his pride and vanity attach him to a form of government
which favors his pretensions and gives him a share in its honors
and distinctions whatever hopes or projects might be entertained
by a few aspiring characters it must generally happen that a
great proportion of the men deriving their advancement from their
of representatives restraining them from oppressive measures
that they can make no law which will not have its full operation
on themselves and their friends as well as on the great mass of
the society this has always been deemed one of the strongest
bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and the people
together it creates between them that communion of interests and
it is possible that these may all be insufficient to control the
caprice and wickedness of man but are they not all that
government will admit and that human prudence can devise are
they not the genuine and the characteristic means by which
republican government provides for the liberty and happiness of
the people are they not the identical means on which every state
other very grossly departed from we have seen how far such a
supposition would err as to the two first points nor would it
in fact be less erroneous as to the last the only difference
discoverable between the two cases is that each representative
of the united states will be elected by five or six thousand
citizens whilst in the individual states the election of a
suffrage must we not deprive the people of the immediate choice
of their public servants in every instance where the
administration of the government does not require as many of them
as will amount to one for that number of citizens is the
doctrine warranted by facts it was shown in the last paper that
the real representation in the british house of commons very
need not resort to foreign experience on this subject our own
is explicit and decisive the districts in new hampshire in
which the senators are chosen immediately by the people are
nearly as large as will be necessary for her representatives in
the congress those of massachusetts are larger than will be
necessary for that purpose and those of new york still more so
one county in which every elector votes for each of its
representatives in the state legislature and what may appear to
be still more directly to our purpose the whole city actually
elects a single member for the executive council this is the
case in all the other counties of the state are not these facts
the most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been

undermine the public liberty publius

the short term of three years within every successive term of
ten years a census of inhabitants is to be repeated the
unequivocal objects of these regulations are first to readjust
from time to time the apportionment of representatives to the
number of inhabitants under the single exception that each state
shall have one representative at least secondly to augment the
latter the peculiarity lies in this that one branch of the
legislature is a representation of citizens the other of the
states in the former consequently the larger states will have
most weight in the latter the advantage will be in favor of the
smaller states from this circumstance it may with certainty be
inferred that the larger states will be strenuous advocates for
probably created the most serious apprehensions in the jealous
friends of a numerous representation fortunately it is among
the difficulties which existing only in appearance vanish on a
close and accurate inspection the following reflections will
if i mistake not be admitted to be conclusive and satisfactory
on this point notwithstanding the equal authority which will
opposition to their just and legitimate pretensions hence it is
by no means certain that a majority of votes even in the
senate would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number
of representatives it will not be looking too far to add that
the senators from all the new states may be gained over to the
just views of the house of representatives by an expedient too
with the larger states by which they will be able at all times
to accomplish their just purposes the house of representatives
cannot only refuse but they alone can propose the supplies
requisite for the support of government they in a word hold
the purse that powerful instrument by which we behold in the
history of the british constitution an infant and humble
cases the smaller the number and the more permanent and
conspicuous the station of men in power the stronger must be
the interest which they will individually feel in whatever
concerns the government those who represent the dignity of their
country in the eyes of other nations will be particularly
sensible to every prospect of public danger or of dishonorable
the constitution as has been shown by the smallness of the number
proposed i omit also any remarks on the difficulty which might
be found under present circumstances in engaging in the federal
service a large number of such characters as the people will
probably elect one observation however i must be permitted to
add on this subject as claiming in my judgment a very serious
of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people
ignorance will be the dupe of cunning and passion the slave of
sophistry and declamation the people can never err more than in
supposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a
certain limit they strengthen the barrier against the government
of a few experience will forever admonish them that on the
shield to some particular interests and another obstacle
generally to hasty and partial measures but these considerations
are outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale in
all cases where justice or the general good might require new
laws to be passed or active measures to be pursued the
fundamental principle of free government would be reversed it
from the new york packet friday february   
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the natural order of the subject leads us to consider in this
place that provision of the constitution which authorizes the
national legislature to regulate in the last resort the
preservation every just reasoner will at first sight approve
an adherence to this rule in the work of the convention and
will disapprove every deviation from it which may not appear to
have been dictated by the necessity of incorporating into the
work some particular ingredient with which a rigid conformity to
the rule was incompatible even in this case though he may
regulation of elections for the federal government in the first
instance to the local administrations which in ordinary
cases and when no improper views prevail may be both more
convenient and more satisfactory but they have reserved to the
national authority a right to interpose whenever extraordinary
circumstances might render that interposition necessary to its
theory to trust the union with the care of its own existence
than to transfer that care to any other hands if abuses of power
are to be hazarded on the one side or on the other it is more
rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be
placed than where it would unnaturally be placed suppose an
article had been introduced into the constitution empowering the
alleged that by declining the appointment of senators they
might at any time give a fatal blow to the union and from this
it may be inferred that as its existence would be thus rendered
dependent upon them in so essential a point there can be no
objection to intrusting them with it in the particular case under
consideration the interest of each state it may be added to
a place in the organization of the national government if this
had been done it would doubtless have been interpreted into an
entire dereliction of the federal principle and would certainly
have deprived the state governments of that absolute safeguard
which they will enjoy under this provision but however wise it
may have been to have submitted in this instance to an
activity of the body and it is not from a general and permanent
combination of the states that we can have any thing to fear the
first might proceed from sinister designs in the leading members
of a few of the state legislatures the last would suppose a
fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the people
which will either never exist at all or will in all
as complete by those who attend to the force of an obvious
distinction between the interest of the people in the public
felicity and the interest of their local rulers in the power and
consequence of their offices the people of america may be
warmly attached to the government of the union at times when the
particular rulers of particular states stimulated by the natural
seizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the
people and which perhaps they may themselves have excited to
discontinue the choice of members for the federal house of
representatives it ought never to be forgotten that a firm
union of this country under an efficient government will
probably be an increasing object of jealousy to more than one
to the people of the state of new york
we have seen that an uncontrollable power over the elections to
 the federal government could not without hazard be committed to
 the state legislatures let us now see what would be the danger on
 the other side that is from confiding the ultimate right of
 regulating its own elections to the union itself it is not
the improbability of the attempt may be satisfactorily inferred
 from this single reflection that it could never be made without
 causing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people headed
 and directed by the state governments it is not difficult to
 conceive that this characteristic right of freedom may in certain
 turbulent and factious seasons be violated in respect to a
 in their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions
 in society and though an intimate intercourse under the same
 government will promote a gradual assimilation in some of these
 respects yet there are causes as well physical as moral which
 may in a greater or less degree permanently nourish different
 propensities and inclinations in this respect but the circumstance
 attempted for what inducement could the senate have to concur in a
 preference in which itself would not be included or to what
 purpose would it be established in reference to one branch of the
 legislature if it could not be extended to the other the
 composition of the one would in this case counteract that of the
 other and we can never suppose that it would embrace the
if this partiality is to be exerted in favor of those who are
 concerned in any particular description of industry or property i
 presume it will readily be admitted that the competition for it
 will lie between landed men and merchants and i scruple not to
 affirm that it is infinitely less likely that either of them should
 gain an ascendant in the national councils than that the one or the
 where the rules of an equal representation obtain the landed
 interest must upon the whole preponderate in the government as
 long as this interest prevails in most of the state legislatures so
 long it must maintain a correspondent superiority in the national
 senate which will generally be a faithful copy of the majorities of
 those assemblies it cannot therefore be presumed that a sacrifice
 there is little likelihood that the supposition of such a bias will
 have any terrors for those who would be immediately injured by it a
 labored answer to this question will be dispensed with it will be
 sufficient to remark first that for the reasons elsewhere
 assigned it is less likely that any decided partiality should
 prevail in the councils of the union than in those of any of its
 meaning of the objectors they contemplate a discrimination of
 another kind they appear to have in view as the objects of the
 preference with which they endeavor to alarm us those whom they
 designate by the description of the wealthy and the wellborn
 these it seems are to be exalted to an odious preeminence over
 the rest of their fellowcitizens at one time however their
 particular districts would be as subversive of its own aim as it
 would be exceptionable on every other account the truth is that
 there is no method of securing to the rich the preference
 apprehended but by prescribing qualifications of property either
 for those who may elect or be elected but this forms no part of
 the power to be conferred upon the national government its
 parts of these papers but that the futility of the objection under
 consideration may appear in the strongest light it shall be
 conceded for a moment that such a force might exist and the
 national government shall be supposed to be in the actual possession
 of it what will be the conclusion with a disposition to invade
 the essential rights of the community and with the means of
 particularly in the southern states and in this state

the same subject continued
concerning the power of congress to regulate the election of
 members
from the new york packet
 as a serious still less as an insuperable objection to the plan
 the different views taken of the subject in the two preceding
 papers must be sufficient to satisfy all dispassionate and
 discerning men that if the public liberty should ever be the victim
 of the ambition of the national rulers the power under examination
 at least will be guiltless of the sacrifice
 readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the
 legislature of new york to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of
 new york by confining elections to particular places than for the
 legislature of the united states to defeat the suffrages of the
 citizens of the union by the like expedient suppose for
 instance the city of albany was to be appointed the sole place of
 conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or
 twenty thousand miles hence it must appear that objections to the
 particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections
 will in substance apply with equal force to the modification of
 the like power in the constitution of this state and for this
 reason it will be impossible to acquit the one and to condemn the
 impregnable to the lust of power or other sinister motives than
 the representatives of the people of the united states if they
 cannot do this they ought at least to prove to us that it is easier
 to subvert the liberties of three millions of people with the
 advantage of local governments to head their opposition than of two
 hundred thousand people who are destitute of that advantage and in
 elections for the federal house of representatives it is more than
 possible that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of
 great importance to the public welfare both as a security against
 the perpetuation of the same spirit in the body and as a cure for
 the diseases of faction if each state may choose its own time of
 election it is possible there may be at least as many different
uniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for
 executing the idea of a regular rotation in the senate and for
 conveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each
 year
it may be asked why then could not a time have been fixed in
 the constitution as the most zealous adversaries of the plan of

the senate
for the independent journal
hamilton or madison
to the people of the state of new york
having examined the constitution of the house of
 the nature of the senatorial trust which requiring greater extent
 of information and tability of character requires at the same time
 that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to
 supply these advantages and which participating immediately in
 transactions with foreign nations ought to be exercised by none who
 are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits
 two systems
iii the equality of representation in the senate is another
 point which being evidently the result of compromise between the
 opposite pretensions of the large and the small states does not
 call for much discussion if indeed it be right that among a
 people thoroughly incorporated into one nation every district ought
 be obtained from the smaller states the only option then for the
 former lies between the proposed government and a government still
 more objectionable under this alternative the advice of prudence
 must be to embrace the lesser evil and instead of indulging a
 fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue to
 contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify
 instances be injurious as well as beneficial and that the peculiar
 defense which it involves in favor of the smaller states would be
 more rational if any interests common to them and distinct from
 those of the other states would otherwise be exposed to peculiar
 danger but as the larger states will always be able by their
 power over the supplies to defeat unreasonable exertions of this
 constituents and prove unfaithful to their important trust in
 this point of view a senate as a second branch of the legislative
 assembly distinct from and dividing the power with a first must
 be in all cases a salutary check on the government it doubles the
 security to the people by requiring the concurrence of two distinct
 bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy where the ambition or
 other nations but a position that will not be contradicted need
 not be proved all that need be remarked is that a body which is
 to correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it and
 consequently ought to be less numerous it ought moreover to
 possess great firmness and consequently ought to hold its authority
 by a tenure of considerable duration
 wisdom so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against
 each preceding session so many admonitions to the people of the
 value of those aids which may be expected from a wellconstituted
 senate
a good government implies two things first fidelity to the
 object of government which is the happiness of the people
 and every prospect of success the remark is verified in private
 life and becomes more just as well as more important in national
 transactions
to trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would
 fill a volume i will hint a few only each of which will be
 perceived to be a source of innumerable others
 neighbors but the best instruction on this subject is unhappily
 conveyed to america by the example of her own situation she finds
 that she is held in no respect by her friends that she is the
 derision of her enemies and that she is a prey to every nation
 which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and
 embarrassed affairs
 new harvest to those who watch the change and can trace its
 consequences a harvest reared not by themselves but by the toils
 and cares of the great body of their fellowcitizens this is a
 state of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws
 are made for the few not for the many
in another point of view great injury results from an unstable
 and disappoints so many of their flattering hopes no government
 any more than an individual will long be respected without being
 truly respectable nor be truly respectable without possessing a
 certain portion of order and stability
publius
federalist no 
 various accounts that it should appear to other nations as the
 offspring of a wise and honorable policy the second is that in
 doubtful cases particularly where the national councils may be
 warped by some strong passion or momentary interest the presumed or
 known opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide that can
 be followed what has not america lost by her want of character
 foreign nations or even by the sister states whilst it can
 scarcely be doubted that if the concurrence of a select and stable
 body had been necessary a regard to national character alone would
 have prevented the calamities under which that misguided people is
 now laboring
i add as a sixth defect the want in some important cases of a
 country needs no explanation and yet it is evident that an
 assembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more
 than one or two links in a chain of measures on which the general
 welfare may essentially depend ought not to be answerable for the
 final result any more than a steward or tenant engaged for one
 year could be justly made to answer for places or improvements
 prejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom i address i shall
 not scruple to add that such an institution may be sometimes
 necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary
 errors and delusions as the cool and deliberate sense of the
 community ought in all governments and actually will in all free
 governments ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers so
 region cannot like the crowded inhabitants of a small district be
 subject to the infection of violent passions or to the danger of
 combining in pursuit of unjust measures i am far from denying that
 this is a distinction of peculiar importance i have on the
 contrary endeavored in a former paper to show that it is one of
 the principal recommendations of a confederated republic at the
 which rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations and that
 a smaller council drawn out of the senate was appointed not only
 for life but filled up vacancies itself these examples though as
 unfit for the imitation as they are repugnant to the genius of
 america are notwithstanding when compared with the fugitive and
 turbulent existence of other ancient republics very instructive
 trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men than where the
 concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every
 public act
the difference most relied on between the american and other
 republics consists in the principle of representation which is
 the pivot on which the former move and which is supposed to have
 archons annually elected by the people at large the degree of
 power delegated to them seems to be left in great obscurity
 subsequent to that period we find an assembly first of four and
 afterwards of six hundred members annually elected by the people
 and partially representing them in their legislative capacity
 since they were not only associated with the people in the function
from these facts to which many others might be added it is
 clear that the principle of representation was neither unknown to
 the ancients nor wholly overlooked in their political constitutions
 the true distinction between these and the american governments
 lies in the total exclusion of the people in their collective
 capacity from any share in the latter and not in the total
to this general answer the general reply ought to be
 sufficient that liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty
 as well as by the abuses of power that there are numerous
 instances of the former as well as of the latter and that the
 former rather than the latter are apparently most to be
 apprehended by the united states but a more particular reply may
 proposed senate can by any possible means within the compass of
 human address arrive at the object of a lawless ambition through
 all these obstructions
if reason condemns the suspicion the same sentence is
 pronounced by experience the constitution of maryland furnishes
 the most apposite example the senate of that state is elected as
 constitution is daily deriving from the salutary operation of this
 part of it a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled
 by that of any state in the union
but if any thing could silence the jealousies on this subject
 it ought to be the british example the senate there instead of
 being elected for a term of six years and of being unconfined to
 the ephori the annual representatives of the people were found an
 overmatch for the senate for life continually gained on its
 authority and finally drew all power into their own hands the
 tribunes of rome who were the representatives of the people
 prevailed it is well known in almost every contest with the senate
 for life and in the end gained the most complete triumph over it
 to its primitive form and principles against the force of the
 immediate representatives of the people nothing will be able to
 maintain even the constitutional authority of the senate but such a
 display of enlightened policy and attachment to the public good as
 will divide with that branch of the legislature the affections and
 support of the entire body of the people themselves
 the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two
 thirds of the senators present concur
the power of making treaties is an important one especially as
 it relates to war peace and commerce and it should not be
 delegated but in such a mode and with such precautions as will
 afford the highest security that it will be exercised by men the
 directed to those men only who have become the most distinguished by
 their abilities and virtue and in whom the people perceive just
 grounds for confidence the constitution manifests very particular
 attention to this object by excluding men under thirtyfive from
 the first office and those under thirty from the second it
 confines the electors to men of whom the people have had time to
 be safely lodged
although the absolute necessity of system in the conduct of any
 business is universally known and acknowledged yet the high
 importance of it in national affairs has not yet become sufficiently
 impressed on the public mind they who wish to commit the power
 under consideration to a popular assembly composed of members
 less prudence in providing for the frequent elections of senators in
 such a way as to obviate the inconvenience of periodically
 transferring those great affairs entirely to new men for by
 leaving a considerable residue of the old ones in place uniformity
 and order as well as a constant succession of official information
 will be preserved
 descriptions who would rely on the secrecy of the president but
 who would not confide in that of the senate and still less in that
 of a large popular assembly the convention have done well
 therefore in so disposing of the power of making treaties that
 although the president must in forming them act by the advice and
 consent of the senate yet he will be able to manage the business of
 heretofore suffered from the want of secrecy and despatch that the
 constitution would have been inexcusably defective if no attention
 had been paid to those objects those matters which in negotiations
 usually require the most secrecy and the most despatch are those
 preparatory and auxiliary measures which are not otherwise important
 in a national view than as they tend to facilitate the attainment
 given by our governor are as valid and as binding on all persons
 whom they concern as the laws passed by our legislature all
 constitutional acts of power whether in the executive or in the
 judicial department have as much legal validity and obligation as
 if they proceeded from the legislature and therefore whatever
 name be given to the power of making treaties or however obligatory
 which should be binding on them absolutely but on us only so long
 and so far as we may think proper to be bound by it they who make
 laws may without doubt amend or repeal them and it will not be
 disputed that they who make treaties may alter or cancel them but
 still let us not forget that treaties are made not by only one of
 the contracting parties but by both and consequently that as the
 act corruptly they can be punished and if they make
 disadvantageous treaties how are we to get rid of those treaties
as all the states are equally represented in the senate and by
 men the most able and the most willing to promote the interests of
 their constituents they will all have an equal degree of influence
 in that body especially while they continue to be careful in
 it probable that the president and two thirds of the senate will
 ever be capable of such unworthy conduct the idea is too gross and
 too invidious to be entertained but in such a case if it should
 ever happen the treaty so obtained from us would like all other
 fraudulent contracts be null and void by the law of nations
with respect to their responsibility it is difficult to

the remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to
 the senate in a distinct capacity are comprised in their
 participation with the executive in the appointment to offices and
 in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments
 inimical to the accused in many cases it will connect itself with
 the preexisting factions and will enlist all their animosities
 partialities influence and interest on one side or on the other
 and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the
 decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of
 parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt
what it may be asked is the true spirit of the institution
 itself is it not designed as a method of national inquest into the
 conduct of public men if this be the design of it who can so
 properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of
 the nation themselves it is not disputed that the power of
 originating the inquiry or in other words of preferring the
 body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation
 to preserve unawed and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality
 between an individual accused and the representatives of the
 people his accusers
could the supreme court have been relied upon as answering this
 description it is much to be doubted whether the members of that
 in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of
 personal security there will be no jury to stand between the
 judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law and the party
 who is to receive or suffer it the awful discretion which a court
 of impeachments must necessarily have to doom to honor or to infamy
 the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the
 would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend that error in
 the first sentence would be the parent of error in the second
 sentence that the strong bias of one decision would be apt to
 overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to
 vary the complexion of another decision those who know anything of
 human nature will not hesitate to answer these questions in the
 impeachments this union would certainly have been attended with
 several advantages but would they not have been overbalanced by
 the signal disadvantage already stated arising from the agency of
 the same judges in the double prosecution to which the offender
 would be liable to a certain extent the benefits of that union
 will be obtained from making the chief justice of the supreme court
 is this a court formed upon such a plan would either be attended
 with a heavy expense or might in practice be subject to a variety
 of casualties and inconveniences it must either consist of
 permanent officers stationary at the seat of government and of
 course entitled to fixed and regular stipends or of certain
 officers of the state governments to be called upon whenever an
 seem harsh and might not be likely often to be verified yet it
 ought not to be forgotten that the demon of faction will at certain
 seasons extend his sceptre over all numerous bodies of men
but though one or the other of the substitutes which have been
 examined or some other that might be devised should be thought
 preferable to the plan in this respect reported by the convention

 executive upon the acts of the legislative body is admitted by the
 ablest adepts in political science to be an indispensable barrier
 against the encroachments of the latter upon the former and it
 may perhaps with no less reason be contended that the powers
 relating to impeachments are as before intimated an essential
 check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the
 the chancellor and judges to the senators is so inconsiderable
 that the judiciary authority of new york in the last resort may
 with truth be said to reside in its senate if the plan of the
 convention be in this respect chargeable with a departure from the
 celebrated maxim which has been so often mentioned and seems to be
 so little understood how much more culpable must be the
 decide on general principles where it may be deposited with most
 advantage and least inconvenience
if we take this course it will lead to a more intelligible if
 not to a more certain result the disposition of the power of
 making treaties which has obtained in the plan of the convention
 will then if i mistake not appear to be fully justified by the
 branch of every government partaking of the republican genius by
 being generally the favorite of the people will be as generally a
 full match if not an overmatch for every other member of the
 government
but independent of this most active and operative principle to
 secure the equilibrium of the national house of representatives the
 all the peculiar attributes of the senate
a third objection to the senate as a court of impeachments is
 drawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office 
 it is imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the
 conduct of men in whose official creation they had participated
 the principle of this objection would condemn a practice which is
 the senate who will merely sanction the choice of the executive
 should feel a bias towards the objects of that choice strong
 enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so extraordinary as
 to have induced the representatives of the nation to become its
 accusers
if any further arguments were necessary to evince the
 complacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the
 appearances of merit might inspire and the proofs of the want of it
 destroy
a fourth objection to the senate in the capacity of a court of
 impeachments is derived from its union with the executive in the
 power of making treaties this it has been said would constitute
 two thirds of the members of a body selected by the collective
 wisdom of the legislatures of the several states is designed to be
 the pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this
 particular the convention might with propriety have meditated the
 punishment of the executive for a deviation from the instructions
 of the senate or a want of integrity in the conduct of the
 thirds of the senate sacrificing the same interests in an injurious
 treaty with a foreign power the truth is that in all such cases
 it is essential to the freedom and to the necessary independence of
 the deliberations of the body that the members of it should be
 exempt from punishment for acts done in a collective capacity and
 the security to the society must depend on the care which is taken
 resentment from themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of
 their mismanagement and disgrace

 upon the aversion of the people to monarchy they have endeavored to
 enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the
 intended president of the united states not merely as the embryo
 but as the fullgrown progeny of that detested parent to
 establish the pretended affinity they have not scrupled to draw
 resources even from the regions of fiction the authorities of a
 to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance as to unmask
 the disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit
 resemblances which have been so insidiously as well as
 industriously propagated
in the execution of this task there is no man who would not
 find it an arduous effort either to behold with moderation or to
 the united states a power which by the instrument reported is
 expressly allotted to the executives of the individual states i
 mean the power of filling casual vacancies in the senate
this bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has
 been hazarded by a writer who whatever may be his real merit has
 had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his party and
 their next session it is from this last provision that the
 pretended power of the president to fill vacancies in the senate has
 been deduced a slight attention to the connection of the clauses
 and to the obvious meaning of the terms will satisfy us that the
 deduction is not even colorable
the first of these two clauses it is clear only provides a
 appointment is confined to the president and senate jointly and can
 therefore only be exercised during the session of the senate but
 as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually
 in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might
 happen in their recess which it might be necessary for the public
 service to fill without delay the succeeding clause is evidently
 concern in those appointments and would have extended the duration
 in office of the temporary senators to the next session of the
 legislature of the state in whose representation the vacancies had
 happened instead of making it to expire at the end of the ensuing
 session of the national senate the circumstances of the body
 authorized to make the permanent appointments would of course have
 legislature which shall then fill such vacancies here is an
 express power given in clear and unambiguous terms to the state
 executives to fill casual vacancies in the senate by temporary
 appointments which not only invalidates the supposition that the
 clause before considered could have been intended to confer that
 power upon the president of the united states but proves that this

 confided this end will be answered by committing the right of
 making it not to any preestablished body but to men chosen by the
 people for the special purpose and at the particular conjuncture
it was equally desirable that the immediate election should be
 made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the
 station and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation
 public wishes and as the electors chosen in each state are to
 assemble and vote in the state in which they are chosen this
 detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats
 and ferments which might be communicated from them to the people
 than if they were all to be convened at one time in one place
nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable
 suspected of too great devotion to the president in office no
 senator representative or other person holding a place of trust or
 profit under the united states can be of the numbers of the
 electors thus without corrupting the body of the people the
 immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task
 free from any sinister bias their transient existence and their
 single purpose of making the important choice
all these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by
 the convention which is that the people of each state shall
 choose a number of persons as electors equal to the number of
 senators and representatives of such state in the national
 government who shall assemble within the state and vote for some
 merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole
 union or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary
 to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of
 president of the united states it will not be too strong to say
 that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station
 filled by characters preeminent for ability and virtue and this
 been alleged that it would have been preferable to have authorized
 the senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that
 description but two considerations seem to justify the ideas of
 the convention in this respect one is that to secure at all times
 the possibility of a definite resolution of the body it is
 necessary that the president should have only a casting vote and

the president of the united states is to have power to return a
 bill which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature
 of new york because the former would possess singly what the
 latter shares with the chancellor and judges but it would be
 precisely the same with that of the governor of massachusetts whose
 constitution as to this article seems to have been the original
 from which the convention have copied
the president is to be the commanderinchief of the army and
 legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the
 union the king of great britain and the governor of new york have
 at all times the entire command of all the militia within their
 several jurisdictions in this article therefore the power of the
 president would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the
 governor secondly the president is to be commanderinchief
 could be claimed by a president of the united states thirdly
 the power of the president in respect to pardons would extend to
 all cases except those of impeachment the governor of new york
 may pardon in all cases even in those of impeachment except for
 treason and murder is not the power of the governor in this
 article on a calculation of political consequences greater than
 expectation have any influence at all when the probability was
 computed that the person who was to afford that exemption might
 himself be involved in the consequences of the measure and might be
 incapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired
 impunity the better to judge of this matter it will be necessary
 to recollect that by the proposed constitution the offense of
 in this respect is not conclusive and that his conventions with
 foreign powers are subject to the revision and stand in need of the
 ratification of parliament but i believe this doctrine was never
 heard of until it was broached upon the present occasion every
 jurist of that kingdom and every other man acquainted with its
 constitution knows as an established fact that the prerogative of
 the one can perform alone what the other can do only with the
 concurrence of a branch of the legislature it must be admitted
 that in this instance the power of the federal executive would
 exceed that of any state executive but this arises naturally from
 the sovereign power which relates to treaties if the confederacy
 were to be dissolved it would become a question whether the
 otherwise provided for by the constitution the king of great
 britain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor he
 not only appoints to all offices but can create offices he can
 confer titles of nobility at pleasure and has the disposal of an
 immense number of church preferments there is evidently a great
 inferiority in the power of the president in this particular to
 legislature with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the
 governor of new york closeted in a secret apartment with at most
 four and frequently with only two persons and if we at the same
 time consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small
 number of which a council of appointment consists than the
 considerable number of which the national senate would consist we

 who would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other

 candor however demands an acknowledgment that i do not think

 characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent
 degree than the proceedings of any greater number and in
 proportion as the number is increased these qualities will be

 us not to be enamoured of plurality in the executive we have seen
 that the achaeans on an experiment of two praetors were induced to
 abolish one the roman history records many instances of mischiefs
 to the republic from the dissensions between the consuls and
 between the military tribunes who were at times substituted for the
 consuls but it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages
 rome to govern the city and its environs the other taking the
 command in the more distant provinces this expedient must no
 doubt have had great influence in preventing those collisions and
 rivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the
 republic
but quitting the dim light of historical research attaching
 emergencies of the state and what is still worse they might split
 the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions
 adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the
 magistracy
men often oppose a thing merely because they have had no agency
 in planning it or because it may have been planned by those whom
 the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the
 formation of the legislature but it is unnecessary and therefore
 unwise to introduce them into the constitution of the executive
 it is here too that they may be most pernicious in the
 legislature promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a
 benefit the differences of opinion and the jarrings of parties in
 from its plurality
it must be confessed that these observations apply with
 principal weight to the first case supposed that is to a plurality
 of magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme the
 advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect but
 they apply though not with equal yet with considerable weight to
 the multiplication of the executive adds to the difficulty of
 detection in either case it often becomes impossible amidst
 mutual accusations to determine on whom the blame or the punishment
 of a pernicious measure or series of pernicious measures ought
 really to fall it is shifted from one to another with so much
 dexterity and under such plausible appearances that the public
 easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity as to
 render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those
 parties
in the single instance in which the governor of this state is
 coupled with a council that is in the appointment to offices we
 have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration
 uncertainty on whom it ought to fall and secondly the
 opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the
 misconduct of the persons they trust in order either to their
 removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which
 admit of it
in england the king is a perpetual magistrate and it is a
 of great britain it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited
 responsibility of the chief magistrate which serves in some degree
 as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior in the
 american republic it would serve to destroy or would greatly
 diminish the intended and necessary responsibility of the chief
 magistrate himself
a little consideration will satisfy us that the species of
 security sought for in the multiplication of the executive is
 nattainable numbers must be so great as to render combination
 difficult or they are rather a source of danger than of security
 the united credit and influence of several individuals must be more
 formidable to liberty than the credit and influence of either of
 a magistrate who is himself responsible for what he does are
 generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions are
 often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost
 always a cloak to his faults

those politicians and statesmen who have been the most
this unity may be destroyed in two ways either by vesting the
 power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority or
 by vesting it ostensibly in one man subject in whole or in part
 to the control and cooperation of others in the capacity of
 counsellors to him of the first the two consuls of rome may serve
 as an example of the last we shall find examples in the
 derived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those
 magistrates that the dissensions between them were not more
 frequent or more fatal is a matter of astonishment until we advert
 to the singular position in which the republic was almost
 continually placed and to the prudent policy pointed out by the
 circumstances of the state and pursued by the consuls of making a
 ourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good se se we shall
 discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of
 plurality in the executive under any modification whatever
wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common
 enterprise or pursuit there is always danger of difference of
 opinion if it be a public trust or office in which they are
 they dislike but if they have been consulted and have happened to
 disapprove opposition then becomes in their estimation an
 indispensable duty of selflove they seem to think themselves
 bound in honor and by all the motives of personal infallibility to
 defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their
 sentiments men of upright benevolent tempers have too many
 that department of the government though they may sometimes
 obstruct salutary plans yet often promote deliberation and
 circumspection and serve to check excesses in the majority when a
 resolution too is once taken the opposition must be at an end
 that resolution is a law and resistance to it punishable but no
 favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of
 the project of a council whose concurrence is made constitutionally
 necessary to the operations of the ostensible executive an artful
 cabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the
 whole system of administration if no such cabal should exist the
 mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to
 tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of
 opinion is left in suspense about the real author the
 circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or
 misfortune are sometimes so complicated that where there are a
 number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of
 agency though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been
 mismanagement yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose
 scandalous appointments to important offices have been made some
 cases indeed have been so flagrant that all parties have agreed in
 the impropriety of the thing when inquiry has been made the blame
 has been laid by the governor on the members of the council who on
 their part have charged it upon his nomination while the people
 remain altogether at a loss to determine by whose influence their
 maxim which has obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace that he
 is unaccountable for his administration and his person sacred
 nothing therefore can be wiser in that kingdom than to annex to
 the king a constitutional council who may be responsible to the
 nation for the advice they give without this there would be no
 responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea
the idea of a council to the executive which has so generally
 obtained in the state constitutions has been derived from that
 maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the
 hands of a number of men than of a single man if the maxim should
 be admitted to be applicable to the case i should contend that the
 advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous
 them separately when power therefore is placed in the hands of
 so small a number of men as to admit of their interests and views
 being easily combined in a common enterprise by an artful leader
 it becomes more liable to abuse and more dangerous when abused
 than if it be lodged in the hands of one man who from the very
 circumstance of his being alone will be more narrowly watched and
 principal end aimed at by the institution the salaries of the
 members who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of
 government would form an item in the catalogue of public
 expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal
 utility i will only add that prior to the appearance of the
 constitution i rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the

duration in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to
 the energy of the executive authority this has relation to two
 objects to the personal firmness of the executive magistrate in
 the employment of his constitutional powers and to the stability
 of the system of administration which may have been adopted under
 exertion of his powers or from encountering the illhumors however
 transient which may happen to prevail either in a considerable
 part of the society itself or even in a predominant faction in the
 legislative body if the case should only be that he might lay it
 down unless continued by a new choice and if he should be desirous
 of being continued his wishes conspiring with his fears would
 commonly intend the public good this often applies to their very
 errors but their good sense would despise the adulator who should
 pretend that they always reason right about the means of promoting
 it they know from experience that they sometimes err and the
 wonder is that they so seldom err as they do beset as they
 continually are by the wiles of parasites and sycophants by the
 can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors
 of the legislature the latter may sometimes stand in opposition to
 the former and at other times the people may be entirely neutral
 in either supposition it is certainly desirable that the executive
 should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor
 and decision
 tendency is almost irresistible the representatives of the people
 in a popular assembly seem sometimes to fancy that they are the
 people themselves and betray strong symptoms of impatience and
 disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter as
 if the exercise of its rights by either the executive or judiciary
 were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity
 body over the people which might be employed to prevent the
 reelection of a man who by an upright resistance to any sinister
 project of that body should have made himself obnoxious to its
 resentment
it may be asked also whether a duration of four years would
 answer the end proposed and if it would not whether a less
 sensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to pursue 
 though it be probable that as he approached the moment when the
 public were by a new election to signify their sense of his
 conduct his confidence and with it his firmness would decline
 yet both the one and the other would derive support from the
 opportunities which his previous continuance in the station had
 been able in one instance to abolish both the royalty and the
 aristocracy and to overturn all the ancient establishments as well
 in the church as state if they have been able on a recent
 occasion to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an
 innovation attempted by them what would be to be feared from
 an elective magistrate of four years duration with the confined

the administration of government in its largest sense
 comprehends all the operations of the body politic whether
 legislative executive or judiciary but in its most usual and
 perhaps its most precise signification it is limited to executive
 details and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive
 predecessor is very often considered by a successor as the best
 proof he can give of his own capacity and desert and in addition
 to this propensity where the alteration has been the result of
 public choice the person substituted is warranted in supposing that
 the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to
 his measures and that the less he resembles him the more he will
 permanency in a wise system of administration
nothing appears more plausible at first sight nor more
 illfounded upon close inspection than a scheme which in relation
 to the present point has had some respectable advocates i mean that
 of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time and
 then excluding him from it either for a limited period or forever
 arduous enterprises for the public benefit requiring considerable
 time to mature and perfect them if he could flatter himself with
 the prospect of being allowed to finish what he had begun would on
 the contrary deter him from the undertaking when he foresaw that
 he must quit the scene before he could accomplish the work and must
 commit that together with his own reputation to hands which might
 his avarice add to this that the same man might be vain or
 ambitious as well as avaricious and if he could expect to prolong
 his honors by his good conduct he might hesitate to sacrifice his
 appetite for them to his appetite for gain but with the prospect
 before him of approaching an inevitable annihilation his avarice
 would be likely to get the victory over his caution his vanity or
a third ill effect of the exclusion would be the depriving the
 community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief
 magistrate in the exercise of his office that experience is the
 parent of wisdom is an adage the truth of which is recognized by
 the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind what more desirable
 or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations
 say to the preservation of its political existence how unwise
 therefore must be every such selfdenying ordinance as serves to
 prohibit a nation from making use of its own citizens in the manner
 best suited to its exigencies and circumstances without supposing
 the personal essentiality of the man it is evident that a change of
 the chief magistrate at the breaking out of a war or at any
 councils and a variable policy
these are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the
 principle of exclusion they apply most forcibly to the scheme of a
 perpetual exclusion but when we consider that even a partial
 exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote
 and precarious object the observations which have been made will
as to the second supposed advantage there is still greater
 reason to entertain doubts concerning it if the exclusion were to
 be perpetual a man of irregular ambition of whom alone there could
 be reason in any case to entertain apprehension would with
 infinite reluctance yield to the necessity of taking his leave
 forever of a post in which his passion for power and preeminence

 truth by facts examples would not be wanting even in this country
 of the intimidation or seduction of the executive by the terrors or
 allurements of the pecuniary arrangements of the legislative body
it is not easy therefore to commend too highly the judicious
 members will be at liberty to give nor will he be at liberty to

the propriety of a negative has upon some occasions been
 combated by an observation that it was not to be presumed a single
 man would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men and
 that unless this presumption should be entertained it would be
 improper to give the executive magistrate any species of control

 errors which flow from want of due deliberation or of those

 interest it is far less probable that culpable views of any kind

 in relation to the same object than that they should by turns
 legislative body in a free government and the hazard to the
 executive in a trial of strength with that body afford a
 satisfactory security that the negative would generally be employed
 with great caution and there would oftener be room for a charge of
 timidity than of rashness in the exercise of it a king of great
 britain with all his train of sovereign attributes and with all
 consideration how much greater caution may be reasonably expected
 in a president of the united states clothed for the short period of
 four years with the executive authority of a government wholly and
 purely republican
it is evident that there would be greater danger of his not
 using his power when necessary than of his using it too often or
 case i speak now with an eye to a magistrate possessing only a
 common share of firmness there are men who under any
 circumstances will have the courage to do their duty at every
 hazard
but the convention have pursued a mean in this business which
 will both facilitate the exercise of the power vested in this
 argumentative objections to be approved or disapproved by those to
 whom they are addressed in proportion as it would be less apt to
 offend it would be more apt to be exercised and for this very
 reason it may in practice be found more effectual it is to be
 hoped that it will not often happen that improper views will govern
 so large a proportion as two thirds of both branches of the
 with success and its utility has become so apparent that persons
 who in compiling the constitution were violent opposers of it
 have from experience become its declared admirers
i have in another place remarked that the convention in the
 formation of this part of their plan had departed from the model of
 the constitution of this state in favor of that of massachusetts
the command of the military and naval forces and the pardoning
 power of the executive
from the new york packet
tuesday march  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the president may require the opinion in writing of the
 principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any
 subject relating to the duties of their respective officers this
 i consider as a mere redundancy in the plan as the right for which
 it provides would result of itself from the office
he is also to be authorized to grant reprieves and pardons for
 or connivance would beget equal circumspection though of a
 different kind on the other hand as men generally derive
 confidence from their numbers they might often encourage each other
 in an act of obduracy and might be less sensible to the
 apprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected
 clemency on these accounts one man appears to be a more eligible
 good sense is better fitted in delicate conjunctures to balance
 the motives which may plead for and against the remission of the
 punishment than any numerous body whatever it deserves particular
 attention that treason will often be connected with seditions which
 embrace a large proportion of the community as lately happened in
 massachusetts in every such case we might expect to see the
 convening the legislature or one of its branches for the purpose
 of obtaining its sanction to the measure would frequently be the
 occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity the loss of a
 week a day an hour may sometimes be fatal if it should be
 observed that a discretionary power with a view to such
 contingencies might be occasionally conferred upon the president
 senators present concur
though this provision has been assailed on different grounds
 with no small degree of vehemence i scruple not to declare my firm
 persuasion that it is one of the best digested and most
 unexceptionable parts of the plan one ground of objection is the
 trite topic of the intermixture of powers some contending that the
 explanations already given in other places of the true sense of the
 rule upon which that objection is founded and shall take it for
 granted as an inference from them that the union of the executive
 with the senate in the article of treaties is no infringement of
 that rule i venture to add that the particular nature of the
 power of making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that
 force of law but derive it from the obligations of good faith
 they are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject but
 agreements between sovereign and sovereign the power in question
 seems therefore to form a distinct department and to belong
 properly neither to the legislative nor to the executive the
 qualities elsewhere detailed as indispensable in the management of
 moderate or slender fortune and looking forward to a period not
 very remote when he may probably be obliged to return to the station
 from which he was taken might sometimes be under temptations to
 sacrifice his duty to his interest which it would require
 superlative virtue to withstand an avaricious man might be tempted
 to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth
 servant of the senate could not be expected to enjoy the confidence
 and respect of foreign powers in the same degree with the
 constitutional representatives of the nation and of course would
 not be able to act with an equal degree of weight or efficacy
 while the union would from this cause lose a considerable
 advantage in the management of its external concerns the people
 against the admission of the house of representatives to a share in
 the formation of treaties the fluctuating and taking its future
 increase into the account the multitudinous composition of that
 body forbid us to expect in it those qualities which are essential
 to the proper execution of such a trust accurate and comprehensive
 knowledge of foreign politics a steady and systematic adherence to
 that all provisions which require more than the majority of any body
 to its resolutions have a direct tendency to embarrass the
 operations of the government and an indirect one to subject the
 sense of the majority to that of the minority this consideration
 seems sufficient to determine our opinion that the convention have
 gone as far in the endeavor to secure the advantage of numbers in
 to a resolution diminishes the motives to punctual attendance the
 latter by making the capacity of the body to depend on a proportion
 which may be varied by the absence or presence of a single member
 has the contrary effect and as by promoting punctuality it tends
 to keep the body complete there is great likelihood that its
 resolutions would generally be dictated by as great a number in this
 enjoy under the confederation and when we proceed still one step
 further and look forward to the probable augmentation of the
 senate by the erection of new states we shall not only perceive
 ample ground of confidence in the sufficiency of the members to
 whose agency that power will be intrusted but we shall probably be
 led to conclude that a body more numerous than the senate would be
 the president alone or in the courts of law or in the heads of
 departments the president shall have power to fill up all
 vacancies which may happen during the recess of the senate by
 granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next
 session
it has been observed in a former paper that the true test of
 consideration it would leave them little time to do anything else
 when therefore mention is made in the subsequent reasonings of an
 assembly or body of men what is said must be understood to relate
 to a select body or assembly of the description already given the
 people collectively from their number and from their dispersed
 situation cannot be regulated in their movements by that systematic
 to the stations to be filled and to prefer with impartiality the
 persons who may have the fairest pretensions to them he will have
 fewer personal attachments to gratify than a body of men who may
 each be supposed to have an equal number and will be so much the
 less liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship and of
 affection a single welldirected man by a single understanding
 of the party will be more considered than those which fit the
 person for the station in the last the coalition will commonly
 turn upon some interested equivalent give us the man we wish for
 this office and you shall have the one you wish for that this
 will be the usual condition of the bargain and it will rarely
 happen that the advancement of the public service will be the
 difference others who are to be the objects of our choice or
 preference hence in every exercise of the power of appointing to
 offices by an assembly of men we must expect to see a full display
 of all the private and party likings and dislikes partialities and
 antipathies attachments and animosities which are felt by those
 who compose the assembly the choice which may at any time happen
 that the president ought solely to have been authorized to make the
 appointments under the federal government but it is easy to show
 that every advantage to be expected from such an arrangement would
 in substance be derived from the power of nomination which is
 proposed to be conferred upon him while several disadvantages
 which might attend the absolute power of appointment in the hands of
 senate could not be tempted by the preference they might feel to
 another to reject the one proposed because they could not assure
 themselves that the person they might wish would be brought forward
 by a second or by any subsequent nomination they could not even be
 certain that a future nomination would present a candidate in any
 degree more acceptable to them and as their dissent might cast a
 private inclinations and interests than when he was bound to submit
 the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a
 different and independent body and that body an entier branch of
 the legislature the possibility of rejection would be a strong
 motive to care in proposing the danger to his own reputation and
 in the case of an elective magistrate to his political existence
 the institution of delegated power implies that there is a portion
 of virtue and honor among mankind which may be a reasonable
 foundation of confidence and experience justifies the theory it
 has been found to exist in the most corrupt periods of the most
 corrupt governments the venalty of the british house of commons
 has been long a topic of accusation against that body in the
 be impracticable to the executive to corrupt or seduce a majority of
 its members but that the necessity of its cooperation in the
 business of appointments will be a considerable and salutary
 restraint upon the conduct of that magistrate nor is the integrity
 of the senate the only reliance the constitution has provided some
 important guards against the danger of executive influence upon the
it has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected
 from the cooperation of the senate in the business of
 appointments that it would contribute to the stability of the
 administration the consent of that body would be necessary to
 displace as well as to appoint a change of the chief magistrate
 therefore would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution
 in others that it would have an opposite tendency a strong proof
 that neither suggestion is true
to state the first in its proper form is to refute it it
 amounts to this the president would have an improper influence
 over the senate because the senate would have the power of
 restraining him this is an absurdity in terms it cannot admit of
 be personally interested in the result would be too few to admit of
 his being materially affected by the compliances of the senate the
 power which can originate the disposition of honors and emoluments
 is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the power which
 can merely obstruct their course if by influencing the president
 be meant restraining him this is precisely what must have been
 blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the president singly and
 absolutely the censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely
 at the door of the senate aggravated by the consideration of their
 having counteracted the good intentions of the executive if an ill
 appointment should be made the executive for nominating and the
 senate for approving would participate though in different
 of the inconsiderable number of four men can too often be managed
 without much difficulty that if some of the members of a
 particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying character
 it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their opposition by
 regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to render their
 attendance inconvenient and that from whatever cause it may
 desire of mutual gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of
 votes and bargaining for places the private attachments of one man
 might easily be satisfied but to satisfy the private attachments
 of a dozen or of twenty men would occasion a monopoly of all the
 principal employments of the government in a few families and would
 lead more directly to an aristocracy or an oligarchy than any
 subject of appointments without taking notice of a scheme for which
 there have appeared some though but few advocates i mean that of
 uniting the house of representatives in the power of making them i
 shall however do little more than mention it as i cannot imagine
 that it is likely to gain the countenance of any considerable part
 of the community a body so fluctuating and at the same time so
 commissioning all the officers of the united states
except some cavils about the power of convening either house of
 the legislature and that of receiving ambassadors no objection has
 been made to this class of authorities nor could they possibly
 admit of any it required indeed an insatiable avidity for
 censure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted
 question has been anticipated in the investigation of its other
 characteristics and is satisfactorily deducible from these
 circumstances from the election of the president once in four
 years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose
 and from his being at all times liable to impeachment trial
 dismission from office incapacity to serve in any other and to
 the proposed government
in unfolding the defects of the existing confederation the
 utility and necessity of a federal judicature have been clearly
 pointed out it is the less necessary to recapitulate the
 considerations there urged as the propriety of the institution in
 the abstract is not disputed the only questions which have been
 responsibility
according to the plan of the convention all judges who may be
 appointed by the united states are to hold their offices during good
 behavior which is conformable to the most approved of the state
 constitutions and among the rest to that of this state its
 propriety having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that
 injure them the executive not only dispenses the honors but holds
 the sword of the community the legislature not only commands the
 purse but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of
 every citizen are to be regulated the judiciary on the contrary
 has no influence over either the sword or the purse no direction
 either of the strength or of the wealth of the society and can
 legislative and executive powers and it proves in the last
 place that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary
 alone but would have every thing to fear from its union with either
 of the other departments that as all the effects of such a union
 must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter
 notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation that as from
 constitution void without this all the reservations of particular
 rights or privileges would amount to nothing
some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce
 legislative acts void because contrary to the constitution has
 arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a
 superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power it is urged
 constitutional judges of their own powers and that the construction
 they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments it may
 be answered that this cannot be the natural presumption where it
 is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the
 constitution it is not otherwise to be supposed that the
 constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the
 the judicial to the legislative power it only supposes that the
 power of the people is superior to both and that where the will of
 the legislature declared in its statutes stands in opposition to
 that of the people declared in the constitution the judges ought
 to be governed by the latter rather than the former they ought to
 regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws rather than by
 the thing it is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative
 provision but adopted by themselves as consonant to truth and
 propriety for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the
 law they thought it reasonable that between the interfering acts
 of an equal authority that which was the last indication of its
 will should have the preference
 disposed to exercise will instead of judgment the consequence would
 equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the
 legislative body the observation if it prove any thing would
 prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body
if then the courts of justice are to be considered as the
 bulwarks of a limited constitution against legislative
 republican government which admits the right of the people to alter
 or abolish the established constitution whenever they find it
 inconsistent with their happiness yet it is not to be inferred from
 this principle that the representatives of the people whenever a
 momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their
 constituents incompatible with the provisions in the existing
 safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the
 society these sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of
 the private rights of particular classes of citizens by unjust and
 partial laws here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is
 of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the
 operation of such laws it not only serves to moderate the
 he may be a gainer today and every man must now feel that the
 inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of
 public and private confidence and to introduce in its stead
 universal distrust and distress
that inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the
 constitution and of individuals which we perceive to be
 great propriety that a voluminous code of laws is one of the
 inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free
 government to avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts it is
 indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and
 precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every
 particular case that comes before them and it will readily be
 qualified to conduct it with utility and dignity in the present
 circumstances of this country and in those in which it is likely to
 be for a long time to come the disadvantages on this score would be
 greater than they may at first sight appear but it must be
 confessed that they are far inferior to those which present
 themselves under the other aspects of the subject

the judiciary continued
from mcleans edition new york
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
next to permanency in office nothing can contribute more to the
 convention accordingly has provided that the judges of the united
 states shall at stated times receive for their services a
 compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance
 in office
this all circumstances considered is the most eligible
 provision that could have been devised it will readily be
 by the convention between the compensation of the president and of
 the judges that of the former can neither be increased nor
 diminished that of the latter can only not be diminished this
 probably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective
 offices as the president is to be elected for no more than four
 years it can rarely happen that an adequate salary fixed at the
 disqualified for holding any other this is the only provision on
 the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the
 judicial character and is the only one which we find in our own
 constitution in respect to our own judges
the want of a provision for removing the judges on account of
 inability has been a subject of complaint but all considerate men
 proper than to that of a judge the deliberating and comparing
 faculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period
 in men who survive it and when in addition to this circumstance
 we consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual
 vigor and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the
 bench whether more or less numerous should be in such a situation
to the people of the state of new york
to judge with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal
 judicature it will be necessary to consider in the first place
 what are its proper objects
it seems scarcely to admit of controversy that the judicary
 authority of the union ought to extend to these several descriptions
 some constitutional mode of enforcing the observance of them the
 states by the plan of the convention are prohibited from doing a
 variety of things some of which are incompatible with the interests
 of the union and others with the principles of good government
 the imposition of duties on imported articles and the emission of
 paper money are specimens of each kind no man of sense will
 arising upon the same laws is a hydra in government from which
 nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed
still less need be said in regard to the third point
 controversies between the nation and its members or citizens can
 only be properly referred to the national tribunals any other plan
 would be contrary to reason to precedent and to decorum
 states but it is at least problematical whether an unjust
 sentence against a foreigner where the subject of controversy was
 wholly relative to the lex loci would not if unredressed be
 an aggression upon his sovereign as well as one which violated the
 stipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations and a still
 greater objection to the distinction would result from the immense
 tranquillity of the empire this was a court invested with
 authority to decide finally all differences among the members of the
 germanic body
a method of terminating territorial disputes between the states
 under the authority of the federal head was not unattended to even
 in the imperfect system by which they have been hitherto held
 of citizens of the several states and if it be a just principle
 that every government ought to possess the means of executing its
 own provisions by its own authority it will follow that in order
 to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and
 immunities to which the citizens of the union will be entitled the
 national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one state
 submitted to federal jurisdiction
the reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases
 in which the state tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial
 speaks for itself no man ought certainly to be a judge in his own
 cause or in any cause in respect to which he has the least interest
 or bias this principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating
 it is to comprehend all cases in law and equity arising under
 the constitution the laws of the united states and treaties made
 or which shall be made under their authority to all cases
 affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls to all
 cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to controversies to
 which the united states shall be a party to controversies between
 examples of it they are not for instance to emit paper money
 but the interdiction results from the constitution and will have
 no connection with any law of the united states should paper
 money notwithstanding be emited the controversies concerning it
 would be cases arising under the constitution and not the laws of
 the united states in the ordinary signification of the terms this
 concerned on either side it would be impossible for the federal
 judicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal
 jurisdiction agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants
 of different states may afford another example of the necessity of
 an equitable jurisdiction in the federal courts this reasoning may
 not be so palpable in those states where the formal and technical
 different states these belong to the fourth of those classes and
 partake in some measure of the nature of the last
sixth to cases between the citizens of the same state
 claiming lands under grants of different states these fall within
 the last class and are the only instances in which the proposed
 constitution directly contemplates the cognizance of disputes
 inconveniences the possibility of particular mischiefs can never
 be viewed by a wellinformed mind as a solid objection to a general
 principle which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to
 obtain general advantages

 been raised concerning it is whether it ought to be a distinct
 body or a branch of the legislature the same contradiction is
 observable in regard to this matter which has been remarked in
 several other cases the very men who object to the senate as a
 court of impeachments on the ground of an improper intermixture of
 powers advocate by implication at least the propriety of vesting
 of the several states can at any time rectify by law the
 exceptionable decisions of their respective courts but the errors
 and usurpations of the supreme court of the united states will be
 uncontrollable and remediless this upon examination will be
 found to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived
 fact
but perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist
 in the particular organization of the supreme court in its being
 composed of a distinct body of magistrates instead of being one of
 the branches of the legislature as in the government of great
 britain and that of the state to insist upon this point the
 authors of the objection must renounce the meaning they have labored
 for judicial offices militates against placing the judiciary power
 in the last resort in a body composed of men chosen for a limited
 period there is an absurdity in referring the determination of
 causes in the first instance to judges of permanent standing in
 the last to those of a temporary and mutable constitution and
 there is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of
 bodies of men contrary to the supposition of those who have
 represented the plan of the convention in this respect as novel
 and unprecedented it is but a copy of the constitutions of new
 hampshire massachusetts pennsylvania delaware maryland
 virginia north carolina south carolina and georgia and the
 preference which has been given to those models is highly to be
 and extent to the state governments as to the national government
 now under consideration not the least difference can be pointed
 out in any view of the subject
it may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of
 judiciary encroachments on the legislative authority which has been
 upon many occasions reiterated is in reality a phantom particular
 this body was possessed of the means of punishing their presumption
 by degrading them from their stations while this ought to remove
 all apprehensions on the subject it affords at the same time a
 cogent argument for constituting the senate a court for the trial of
 impeachments
having now examined and i trust removed the objections to the
 necessary part of the plan if it were only to empower the national
 legislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising out
 of the national constitution to confer the power of determining
 such causes upon the existing courts of the several states would
 perhaps be as much to constitute tribunals as to create new
 courts with the like power but ought not a more direct and
 well satisfied as i am of the propriety of the appellate
 jurisdiction in the several classes of causes to which it is
 extended by the plan of the convention i should consider every
 thing calculated to give in practice an unrestrained course to
 appeals as a source of public and private inconvenience
i am not sure but that it will be found highly expedient and
 the supreme court is to be invested with original jurisdiction
 only in cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and
 consuls and those in which a state shall be a party public
 ministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their
 sovereigns all questions in which they are concerned are so
 directly connected with the public peace that as well for the
 foundation
it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable
 to the suit of an individual without its consent this is the
 general sense and the general practice of mankind and the
 exemption as one of the attributes of sovereignty is now enjoyed
 by the government of every state in the union unless therefore
 without waging war against the contracting state and to ascribe to
 the federal courts by mere implication and in destruction of a
 preexisting right of the state governments a power which would
 involve such a consequence would be altogether forced and
 unwarrantable
let us resume the train of our observations we have seen that
 commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law 
 but if i am not misinformed the same meaning would not be given
 to it in any part of new england there an appeal from one jury to
 another is familiar both in language and practice and is even a
 matter of course until there have been two verdicts on one side
 the word appellate therefore will not be understood in the
 ascertained by a jury will be permitted in the supreme court why
 may not it be said with the strictest propriety when a writ of
 error is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this
 state that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the
 law it is true it cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the
 fact but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record
 law in the former the revision of the law only will be generally
 speaking the proper province of the supreme court in the latter
 the reexamination of the fact is agreeable to usage and in some
 cases of which prize causes are an example might be essential to
 the preservation of the public peace it is therefore necessary
 that the appellate jurisdiction should in certain cases extend in
 united states would certainly have full power to provide that in
 appeals to the supreme court there should be no reexamination of
 facts where they had been tried in the original causes by juries
 this would certainly be an authorized exception but if for the
 reason already intimated it should be thought too extensive it
 might be qualified with a limitation to such causes only as are
 have been predicted from that source
publius
 article  sec i
 this power has been absurdly represented as intended to
 abolish all the county courts in the several states which are
 commonly called inferior courts but the expressions of the
the erection of a new government whatever care or wisdom may
 distinguish the work cannot fail to originate questions of
 intricacy and nicety and these may in a particular manner be
 expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded
 upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct
 sovereignties t is time only that can mature and perfect so
 authority is in express terms granted to the union or where a
 particular authority is granted to the union and the exercise of a
 like authority is prohibited to the states or where an authority
 is granted to the union with which a similar authority in the
 states would be utterly incompatible though these principles may
 not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative
 courts as congress should think proper to appoint or in other
 words that the united states should exercise the judicial power
 with which they are to be invested through one supreme tribunal
 and a certain number of inferior ones to be instituted by them
 the first excludes the last admits the concurrent jurisdiction of
 the state tribunals and as the first would amount to an alienation
 and i am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not
 expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature
 they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those
 acts may give birth this i infer from the nature of judiciary
 power and from the general genius of the system the judiciary
 power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal
 supreme court in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in
 which it is not to have an original one without a single expression
 to confine its operation to the inferior federal courts the
 objects of appeal not the tribunals from which it is to be made
 are alone contemplated from this circumstance and from the reason
 of the thing it ought to be construed to extend to the state
 is that all the causes of the specified classes shall for weighty
 public reasons receive their original or final determination in the
 courts of the union to confine therefore the general expressions
 giving appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court to appeals from
 the subordinate federal courts instead of allowing their extension
 to the state courts would be to abridge the latitude of the terms
 them are that they shall be inferior to the supreme court and
 that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal
 judiciary whether their authority shall be original or appellate
 or both is not declared all this seems to be left to the
 discretion of the legislature and this being the case i perceive
 at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
the objection to the plan of the convention which has met with
 most success in this state and perhaps in several of the other
 states is that relative to the want of a constitutional provision
 for the trial by jury in civil cases the disingenuous form in
 thing which is only not provided for is entirely abolished every
 man of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between
 silence and abolition but as the inventors of this fallacy have
 attempted to support it by certain legal maxims of interpretation
 which they have perverted from their true meaning it may not be
 wholly useless to explore the ground they have taken
 doing of another which there was a previous power to do and which
 is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done if such a
 supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable it cannot be
 rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in
 certain cases is an interdiction of it in others
a power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of
 by jury in civil cases would not be abolished and that the use
 attempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted is
 contrary to reason and commonsense and therefore not admissible
 even if these maxims had a precise technical sense corresponding
 with the idea of those who employ them upon the present occasion
 which however is not the case they would still be inapplicable to
 precise limits beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their
 jurisdiction because the objects of their cognizance being
 enumerated the specification would be nugatory if it did not
 exclude all ideas of more extensive authority
these examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have
 been mentioned and to designate the manner in which they should be
 could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman
 might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for
 conveying property of inferior value the position is too absurd to
 merit a refutation and yet this is precisely the position which
 those must establish who contend that the trial by juries in civil
 cases is abolished because it is expressly provided for in cases of
 upon positive violations of the articles of union by acts of the
 state legislatures will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of
 the state tribunals add to this that admiralty causes and almost
 all those which are of equity jurisdiction are determinable under
 our own government without the intervention of a jury and the
 inference from the whole will be that this institution as it
 of this kind would be more curious than beneficial as all are
 satisfied of the utility of the institution and of its friendly
 aspect to liberty but i must acknowledge that i cannot readily
 discern the inseparable connection between the existence of liberty
 and the trial by jury in civil cases arbitrary impeachments
 arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses and arbitrary
as to the mode of collection in this state under our own
 constitution the trial by jury is in most cases out of use the
 taxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of distress
 and sale as in cases of rent and it is acknowledged on all hands
 that this is essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws the
 dilatory course of a trial at law to recover the taxes imposed on
 tamper with a standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned
 for the occasion there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence
 would more easily find its way to the former than to the latter
 the force of this consideration is however diminished by others
 the sheriff who is the summoner of ordinary juries and the clerks
 of courts who have the nomination of special juries are themselves
 jury unless the court could be likewise gained here then is a
 double security and it will readily be perceived that this
 complicated agency tends to preserve the purity of both institutions 
 by increasing the obstacles to success it discourages attempts to
 seduce the integrity of either the temptations to prostitution
 which the judges might have to surmount must certainly be much
 subject i become more convinced of the reality of the obstacles
 which we are authoritatively informed prevented the insertion of a
 provision on this head in the plan of the convention
the great difference between the limits of the jury trial in
 different states is not generally understood and as it must have
 considerable influence on the sentence we ought to pass upon the
 jersey than in new york in pennsylvania this is perhaps still
 more the case for there is no court of chancery in that state and
 its commonlaw courts have equity jurisdiction it has a court of
 admiralty but none of probates at least on the plan of ours
 delaware has in these respects imitated pennsylvania maryland
 approaches more nearly to new york as does also virginia except
 situation of connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire in
 regard to the blending of law equity and admiralty jurisdictions
 are in a similar predicament in the four eastern states the trial
 by jury not only stands upon a broader foundation than in the other
 states but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown in its full
 extent to any of them there is an appeal of course from one jury
 expression for the purpose trial by jury shall be as
 heretofore and this i maintain would be senseless and nugatory
 the united states in their united or collective capacity are the
 object to which all general provisions in the constitution must
 necessarily be construed to refer now it is evident that though
 trial by jury with various limitations is known in each state
 to indispose every wellregulated judgment towards it whether the
 cause should be tried with or without a jury would depend in a
 great number of cases on the accidental situation of the court and
 parties
but this is not in my estimation the greatest objection i
 feel a deep and deliberate conviction that there are many cases in
it will add great weight to this remark in relation to prize
 causes to mention that the method of determining them has been
 thought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between
 different powers of europe and that pursuant to such treaties
 they are determinable in great britain in the last resort before
 the king himself in his privy council where the fact as well as
 contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel over the other and of
 keeping each within the expedient limits besides this the
 circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are
 in many instances so nice and intricate that they are incompatible
 with the genius of trials by jury they require often such long
 deliberate and critical investigation as would be impracticable to
 little to be suspected that the attempt to extend the jurisdiction
 of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be
 unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of
 chancery on the plan upon which they are established in this state
 but will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law
 and to undermine the trial by jury by introducing questions too
 more extensive provision they found it impracticable to devise one
 which would properly answer the end if the first the omission of
 a regulation respecting so partial an object can never be considered
 as a material imperfection in the system if the last it affords a
 strong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing
but this is not all if we advert to the observations already
 pennsylvania minority in one state a cause would receive its
 determination from a jury if the parties or either of them
 requested it but in another state a cause exactly similar to the
 other must be decided without the intervention of a jury because
 the state judicatories varied as to commonlaw jurisdiction
it is obvious therefore that the massachusetts proposition
 state as a model for the whole had been thought of in the
 convention it is to be presumed that the adoption of it in that
 body would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each
 representation in favor of its own government and it must be
 uncertain which of the states would have been taken as the model
 it has been shown that many of them would be improper ones and i
 of the minority of pennsylvania must satisfy every sober mind that
 the establishment of the trial by jury in all cases would have been
 an unpardonable error in the plan
in short the more it is considered the more arduous will appear
 the task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express
 too little to answer the purpose or too much to be advisable or
 of making any precise and proper provision for it in a constitution
 for the united states
the best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a
 constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases
 and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are
 continually happening in the affairs of society may render a
this is now clearly understood to be the case in great britain
 and it is equally so in the state of connecticut and yet it may be
 safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon
 the trial by jury in this state since the revolution though
 provided for by a positive article of our constitution than has
 happened in the same time either in connecticut or great britain
 connecticut which has been always regarded as the most popular
 state in the union can boast of no constitutional provision for
 either
publius
 it has been erroneously insinuated with regard to the court
 of chancery that this court generally tries disputed facts by a
to the people of the state of new york
in the course of the foregoing review of the constitution i
 have taken notice of and endeavored to answer most of the
 objections which have appeared against it there however remain a
 few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or
 were forgotten in their proper places these shall now be
 same thing the other is that the constitution adopts in their
 full extent the common and statute law of great britain by which
 many other rights not expressed in it are equally secured
to the first i answer that the constitution proposed by the
 convention contains as well as the constitution of this state a
 number of such provisions
 any king prince or foreign state article  section  clause
  the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall
 be by jury and such trial shall be held in the state where the
 said crimes shall have been committed but when not committed
 within any state the trial shall be at such place or places as the
 congress may by law have directed section  of the same
 the commission of the fact or in other words the subjecting of
 men to punishment for things which when they were done were
 breaches of no law and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments
 have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments
 of tyranny the observations of the judicious blackstone in
 reference to the latter are well worthy of recital to bereave a
to the second that is to the pretended establishment of the
 common and state law by the constitution i answer that they are
 expressly made subject to such alterations and provisions as the
 legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same
 they are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary
 legislative power and of course have no constitutional sanction
 the bill of rights it is evident therefore that according to
 their primitive signification they have no application to
 constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people and
 executed by their immediate representatives and servants here in
 strictness the people surrender nothing and as they retain every
 thing they have no need of particular reservations we the
 contain all which in relation to their objects is reasonably to be
 desired
i go further and affirm that bills of rights in the sense and
 to the extent in which they are contended for are not only
 unnecessary in the proposed constitution but would even be
 dangerous they would contain various exceptions to powers not
 the doctrine of constructive powers by the indulgence of an
 injudicious zeal for bills of rights
on the subject of the liberty of the press as much as has been
 said i cannot forbear adding a remark or two in the first place
 i observe that there is not a syllable concerning it in the
 constitution of this state in the next i contend that whatever
 great britain form its constitution and conversely the constitution
 of each state is its bill of rights and the proposed constitution
 if adopted will be the bill of rights of the union is it one
 object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political
 privileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of
 the government this is done in the most ample and precise manner
 rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions entirely foreign
 from the substance of the thing
another objection which has been made and which from the
 frequency of its repetition it is to be presumed is relied on is
 of this nature it is improper usay the objectorse to confer such
 large powers as are proposed upon the national government because
 information of intelligent men in whom they confide and how must
 these men obtain their information evidently from the complexion
 of public measures from the public prints from correspondences
 with theirrepresentatives and with other persons who reside at the
 place of their deliberations this does not apply to montgomery
 county only but to all the counties at any considerable distance
 from the rivalship of power and we may conclude with the fullest
 assurance that the people through that channel will be better
 informed of the conduct of their national representatives than they
 can be by any means they now possess of that of their state
 representatives
it ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the
 offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty in addition
 to the remarks i have made upon the subject in another place i
 shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of commonsense so
 it is also an established doctrine of political law that states
 neither lose any of their rights nor are discharged from any of
 their obligations by a change in the form of their civil government
 the two branches of the legislature are in the first instance to
 consist of only sixtyfive persons which is the same number of
 which congress under the existing confederation may be composed
 it is true that this number is intended to be increased but this
 is to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources of
 the country it is evident that a less number would even in the
 their characters where they reside more respectable and their
 services more useful as to persons to be employed in the
 collection of the revenues it is unquestionably true that these
 will form a very considerable addition to the number of federal
 officers but it will not follow that this will occasion an
 increase of public expense it will be in most cases nothing more
 support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense but to what
 extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in
 regard to this matter but upon no reasonable plan can it amount to
 a sum which will be an object of material consequence
let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense
 that may attend the establishment of the proposed government the
but there is another circumstance of great importance in the
 view of economy the business of the united states has hitherto
 occupied the state legislatures as well as congress the latter
 has made requisitions which the former have had to provide for
 hence it has happened that the sessions of the state legislatures
 have been protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the
 may be occasioned by the adoption of the new system
the result from these observations is that the sources of
 additional expense from the establishment of the proposed
 constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined that they
 are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving and that
 while it is questionable on which side the scale will preponderate
 are taxed in great britain and yet it is notorious that the press
 nowhere enjoys greater liberty than in that country and if duties
 of any kind may be laid without a violation of that liberty it is
 evident that the extent must depend on legislative discretion
 respecting the liberty of the press will give it no greater
 security than it will have without them the same invasions of it
 its adoption will afford to republican government to liberty and
 to property but these heads have been so fully anticipated and
 exhausted in the progress of the work that it would now scarcely be
 possible to do any thing more than repeat in a more dilated form
 what has been heretofore said which the advanced stage of the
 question and the time already spent upon it conspire to forbid
 they live than the fury with which they have attacked that plan
 for matters in regard to which our own constitution is equally or
 perhaps more vulnerable
the additional securities to republican government to liberty
 and to property to be derived from the adoption of the plan under
 consideration consist chiefly in the restraints which the
thus have i fellowcitizens executed the task i had assigned
 to myself with what success your conduct must determine i trust
 at least you will admit that i have not failed in the assurance i
 gave you respecting the spirit with which my endeavors should be
 conducted i have addressed myself purely to your judgments and
 have studiously avoided those asperities which are too apt to
 struggle between sensibility and moderation and if the former has
 in some instances prevailed it must be my excuse that it has been
 neither often nor much
let us now pause and ask ourselves whether in the course of
 these papers the proposed constitution has not been satisfactorily
 vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it and whether it has
 to the plan which he is to approve or reject
i shall not dissemble that i feel an entire confidence in the
 arguments which recommend the proposed system to your adoption and
 that i am unable to discern any real force in those by which it has
 been opposed i am persuaded that it is the best which our
 political situation habits and opinions will admit and superior
 upon the whole a good one is the best that the present views and
 circumstances of the country will permit and is such an one as
 promises every species of security which a reasonable people can
 desire
i answer in the next place that i should esteem it the extreme
 of imprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national
 arguments there used as i presume the production itself has had an
 extensive circulation it is certainly well worthy the perusal of
 every friend to his country there is however one point of light
 in which the subject of amendments still remains to be considered
 and in which it has not yet been exhibited to public view i cannot
 resolve to conclude without first taking a survey of it in this
 thirteen independent states are to be accommodated in their
 interests or opinions of interest we may of course expect to see
 in any body of men charged with its original formation very
 different combinations of the parts upon different points many of
 those who form a majority on one question may become the minority
 on a second and an association dissimilar to either may constitute
 between the facility of affecting an amendment and that of
 establishing in the first instance a complete constitution
in opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments it
 has been urged that the persons delegated to the administration of
 the national government will always be disinclined to yield up any
 portion of the authority of which they were once possessed for my
 legislatures of two thirds of the states uwhich at present amount to
 ninee to call a convention for proposing amendments which shall be
 valid to all intents and purposes as part of the constitution
 when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the states or
 by conventions in three fourths thereof the words of this
 article are peremptory the congress shall call a convention
 road to their own object
the zeal for attempts to amend prior to the establishment of
 the constitution must abate in every man who is ready to accede to
 the truth of the following observations of a writer equally solid
 and ingenious to balance a large state or society usays hee
 whether monarchical or republican on general laws is a work of so
 without a national government is in my view an awful spectacle
 the establishment of a constitution in time of profound peace by
 the voluntary ocnsent of a whole people is a prodigy to the
 completion of which i look forward with trembling anxiety i can
 reconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have
 in so arduous an enterprise upon seven out of the thirteen states
