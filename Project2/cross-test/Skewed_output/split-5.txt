          this is the project gutenberg  release of
 establishing good government from reflection and choice or whether
 they are forever destined to depend for their political
 constitutions on accident and force if there be any truth in the
 remark the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be
 regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made and a
 all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power emolument
 and consequence of the offices they hold under the state
 establishments and the perverted ambition of another class of men
 who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of
 their country or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of
 furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much
 persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy and a
 further reason for caution in this respect might be drawn from the
 reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the
 truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists
 their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives an
 enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be
 stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and
 hostile to the principles of liberty an overscrupulous jealousy
 of danger to the rights of the people which is more commonly the
 commencing demagogues and ending tyrants
in the course of the preceding observations i have had an eye
 my fellowcitizens to putting you upon your guard against all
 attempts from whatever quarter to influence your decision in a
 matter of the utmost moment to your welfare by any impressions
i propose in a series of papers to discuss the following
 interesting particulars 
the utility of the union to your political prosperity
the insufficiency of the present confederation
 to preserve that union  the necessity of a government at least
 great extent for any general system and that we must of necessity
 resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the
 whole this doctrine will in all probability be gradually
 propagated till it has votaries enough to countenance an open
 avowal of it for nothing can be more evident to those who are
 to decide a question which in its consequences must prove one of
 the most important that ever engaged their attention the propriety
 of their taking a very comprehensive as well as a very serious
 view of it will be evident
nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of
 confederacies or sovereignties however extraordinary this new
 doctrine may appear it nevertheless has its advocates and certain
 characters who were much opposed to it formerly are at present of
 the number whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have
 wrought this change in the sentiments and declarations of these
 has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united
 peoplea people descended from the same ancestors speaking the same
 language professing the same religion attached to the same
 principles of government very similar in their manners and customs
 and who by their joint counsels arms and efforts fighting side
 people at a very early period to institute a federal government to
 preserve and perpetuate it they formed it almost as soon as they
 had a political existence nay at a time when their habitations
 were in flames when many of their citizens were bleeding and when
 the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those
 of peace with minds unoccupied by other subjects they passed many
 months in cool uninterrupted and daily consultation and finally
 without having been awed by power or influenced by any passions
 except love for their country they presented and recommended to the
 people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils
 consequences or the undue influence of former attachments or whose
 ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public
 good were indefatigable in their efforts to pursuade the people to
 reject the advice of that patriotic congress many indeed were
 deceived and deluded but the great majority of the people reasoned
 used to deter them from it but if the people at large had reason
 to confide in the men of that congress few of whom had been fully
 tried or generally known still greater reason have they now to
 respect the judgment and advice of the convention for it is well
 known that some of the most distinguished members of that congress
 the cause of the union rests on great and weighty reasons which i
 shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers they
 who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct
 confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention seem
 clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the
 respect for the high opinion which the people of america have so
 long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing
 firmly united under one federal government vested with sufficient
 powers for all general and national purposes
the more attentively i consider and investigate the reasons
 against hostilities from abroad
the number of wars which have happened or will happen in the
 world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and
 weight of the causes whether real or pretended which provoke or
 invite them if this remark be just it becomes useful to inquire
 separate states or by three or four distinct confederacies
because when once an efficient national government is
 established the best men in the country will not only consent to
 serve but also will generally be appointed to manage it for
 although town or country or other contracted influence may place
 that as well from the variety of independent courts and judges
 appointed by different and independent governments as from the
 different local laws and interests which may affect and influence
 them the wisdom of the convention in committing such questions to
 the jurisdiction and judgment of courts appointed by and responsible
 inclination to prevent or punish its commission by others
so far therefore as either designed or accidental violations
 of treaties and the laws of nations afford just causes of war they
 are less to be apprehended under one general government than under
 several lesser ones and in that respect the former most favors the
 any will be those who under the impulse of sudden irritation and
 a quick sense of apparent interest or injury will be most likely
 by direct violence to excite war with these nations and nothing
 can so effectually obviate that danger as a national government
 whose wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions
in the year  the state of genoa having offended louis xiv
 endeavored to appease him he demanded that they should send their
 doge or chief magistrate accompanied by four of their
 senators to france to ask his pardon and receive his terms they
 were obliged to submit to it for the sake of peace would he on any
but the safety of the people of america against dangers from
 foreign force depends not only on their forbearing to give just
 causes of war to other nations but also on their placing and
 continuing themselves in such a situation as not to invite hostility
 or insult for it need not be observed that there are pretended as
with france and with britain we are rivals in the fisheries and
 can supply their markets cheaper than they can themselves
 notwithstanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own
 or duties on foreign fish
with them and with most other european nations we are rivals in
spain thinks it convenient to shut the mississippi against us on
 the one side and britain excludes us from the saint lawrence on the
 other nor will either of them permit the other waters which are
 between them and us to become the means of mutual intercourse and
 traffic
 arms and the resources of the country
as the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole and
 cannot be provided for without government either one or more or
 many let us inquire whether one good government is not relative to
 the object in question more competent than any other given number
 three or four distinct independent companies
what would the militia of britain be if the english militia
 obeyed the government of england if the scotch militia obeyed the
 government of scotland and if the welsh militia obeyed the
 government of wales suppose an invasion would those three
 thirteen or if you please into three or four independent
 governmentswhat armies could they raise and paywhat fleets could
 they ever hope to have if one was attacked would the others fly
 to its succor and spend their blood and money in its defense
 would there be no danger of their being flattered into neutrality
 combining and directing the powers and resources of the whole would
 be free from all these embarrassments and conduce far more to the
 safety of the people
but whatever may be our situation whether firmly united under
 one national government or split into a number of confederacies
 family so divide it never fails to be against themselves

the same subject continued
concerning dangers from foreign force and influence
 conclusion being the only effectual way to secure our present and
 future happiness and disappoint the designs of our and your
 enemies who will doubtless on this occasion use their utmost
 endeavors to prevent or delay this union
it was remarked in the preceding paper that weakness and
 each other
should the people of america divide themselves into three or
 four nations would not the same thing happen would not similar
 jealousies arise and be in like manner cherished instead of their
 being joined in affection and free from all apprehension of
 consideration would be destroyed for it cannot be presumed that
 the same degree of sound policy prudence and foresight would
 uniformly be observed by each of these confederacies for a long
 succession of years
whenever and from whatever causes it might happen and happen
 unquestionably more formidable than any of the others no sooner
 would this become evident than the northern hive would excite the
 same ideas and sensations in the more southern parts of america
 which it formerly did in the southern parts of europe nor does it
 appear to be a rash conjecture that its young swarms might often be
when did the independent states into which britain and spain
 were formerly divided combine in such alliance or unite their
 forces against a foreign enemy the proposed confederacies will be
 distinct nations each of them would have its commerce with
 foreigners to regulate by distinct treaties and as their
 than from distant nations and therefore that each of them should be
 more desirous to guard against the others by the aid of foreign
 alliances than to guard against foreign dangers by alliances
 between themselves and here let us not forget how much more easy
 it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports and foreign armies
 enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed in a state
 of disunion from the arms and arts of foreign nations i shall now
 proceed to delineate dangers of a different and perhaps still more
 alarming kindthose which will in all probability flow from
 dissensions between the states themselves and from domestic
 collective bodies of society of this description are the love of
 power or the desire of preeminence and dominionthe jealousy of
 power or the desire of equality and safety there are others which
 have a more circumscribed though an equally operative influence
 within their spheres such are the rivalships and competitions of
 accusations prepared to be brought against him for dissipating the
 funds of the state in the purchase of popularity or from a
 combination of all these causes was the primitive author of that
 famous and fatal war distinguished in the grecian annals by the
 name of the peloponnesian war which after various vicissitudes
 the contemporary policy ferments and pacifications of a
 considerable part of europe are topics that have been too often
 descanted upon not to be generally known
to multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in
 the production of great national events either foreign or domestic
 commerce has a tendency to soften the manners of men and to
 extinguish those inflammable humors which have so often kindled into
 wars commercial republics like ours will never be disposed to
 waste themselves in ruinous contentions with each other they will
 be governed by mutual interest and will cultivate a spirit of
 course liable to be tinctured by the passions and views of those
 individuals has commerce hitherto done anything more than change
 the objects of war is not the love of wealth as domineering and
 enterprising a passion as that of power or glory have there not
 been as many wars founded upon commercial motives since that has
 carthage and made a conquest of the commonwealth
venice in later times figured more than once in wars of
 ambition till becoming an object to the other italian states pope
 julius ii found means to accomplish that formidable league
 which gave a deadly blow to the power and pride of this haughty
 inclinations and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the
 state in that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival
 houses of austria and bourbon which so long kept europe in a flame
 it is well known that the antipathies of the english against the
 french seconding the ambition or rather the avarice of a favorite
 shape is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden
 age and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our
 political conduct that we as well as the other inhabitants of the
 globe are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and
 perfect virtue
 occasions extinguishing that secret jealousy which disposes all
 states to aggrandize themselves at the expense of their
 neighbors this passage at the same time points out the
 evil and suggests the remedy

to the people of the state of new york
 boundaries of the united states there still are discordant and
 undecided claims between several of them and the dissolution of the
 union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them all
 it is well known that they have heretofore had serious and animated
 discussion concerning the rights to the lands which were ungranted
 dispute and would create others on the same subject at present a
 large part of the vacant western territory is by cession at least
 if not by any anterior right the common property of the union if
 that were at an end the states which made the cession on a
 principle of federal compromise would be apt when the motive of the
 that the sword would sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of
 their differences the circumstances of the dispute between
 connecticut and pennsylvania respecting the land at wyoming
 admonish us not to be sanguine in expecting an easy accommodation of
 such differences the articles of confederation obliged the parties
 the peace of the confederacy might have been exposed had this state
 attempted to assert its rights by force two motives preponderated
 in that opposition one a jealousy entertained of our future
 power and the other the interest of certain individuals of
 influence in the neighboring states who had obtained grants of
 of sharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors
 each state or separate confederacy would pursue a system of
 commercial policy peculiar to itself this would occasion
 distinctions preferences and exclusions which would beget
 discontent the habits of intercourse on the basis of equal
 impatiently submitted to by the tributary states the relative
 situation of new york connecticut and new jersey would afford an
 example of this kind new york from the necessities of revenue
 must lay duties on her importations a great part of these duties
 must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other states in the
 apportionment in the first instance and the progressive
 extinguishment afterward would be alike productive of illhumor and
 animosity how would it be possible to agree upon a rule of
 apportionment satisfactory to all there is scarcely any that can
 be proposed which is entirely free from real objections these as
 would be hazarded to the double contingency of external invasion and
 internal contention
suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted and
 the apportionment made still there is great room to suppose that
 the rule agreed upon would upon experiment be found to bear harder
 whatever causes would be productive of complaints recriminations
 and quarrels there is perhaps nothing more likely to disturb the
 tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual
 contributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and
 coincident benefit for it is an observation as true as it is
 states or confederacies and different foreign nations and the
 effects of this situation upon the peace of the whole have been
 sufficiently unfolded in some preceding papers from the view they
 have exhibited of this part of the subject this conclusion is to be
 drawn that america if not connected at all or only by the feeble
tuesday november  
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
assuming it therefore as an established truth that the several
 states in case of disunion or such combinations of them as might
 with chains of fortified places which mutually obstruct invasion
 campaigns are wasted in reducing two or three frontier garrisons
 to gain admittance into an enemys country similar impediments
 occur at every step to exhaust the strength and delay the progress
 of an invader formerly an invading army would penetrate into the
 plunder and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars the
 calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the
 events which would characterize our military exploits
this picture is not too highly wrought though i confess it
 would not long remain a just one safety from external danger is
 require a state of as constant preparation will infallibly produce
 them the weaker states or confederacies would first have recourse
 to them to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent
 neighbors they would endeavor to supply the inferiority of
 population and resources by a more regular and effective system of
 themselves in their lost preeminence thus we should in a little
 time see established in every part of this country the same engines
 of despotism which have been the scourge of the old world this at
 least would be the natural course of things and our reasonings
 will be the more likely to be just in proportion as they are
 industry and the science of finance which is the offspring of
 modern times concurring with the habits of nations have produced
 an entire revolution in the system of war and have rendered
 disciplined armies distinct from the body of the citizens the
 inseparable companions of frequent hostility
 acquiescence in a necessary evil and stand ready to resist a power
 which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights
 the army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate
 to suppress a small faction or an occasional mob or insurrection
 but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united
 the military power
the kingdom of great britain falls within the first description
 an insular situation and a powerful marine guarding it in a great
 measure against the possibility of foreign invasion supersede the
 necessity of a numerous army within the kingdom a sufficient force
 causes but it cannot be by the prowess of an army so
 inconsiderable as that which has been usually kept up within the
 kingdom
if we are wise enough to preserve the union we may for ages
 enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation
 not hesitate to part with trivial objections to a constitution the
 rejection of which would in all probability put a final period to
 the union the airy phantoms that flit before the distempered
 imaginations of some of its adversaries would quickly give place to
 the more substantial forms of dangers real certain and formidable
 and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually
 agitated and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they
 were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of
 tyranny and anarchy if they exhibit occasional calms these only
 serve as shortlived contrast to the furious storms that are to
 mankind stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty which
 have flourished for ages have in a few glorious instances refuted
 their gloomy sophisms and i trust america will be the broad and
 solid foundation of other edifices not less magnificent which will
 be equally permanent monuments of their errors
 of republican government may be retained and its imperfections
 lessened or avoided to this catalogue of circumstances that tend
 to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government i shall
 venture however novel it may appear to some to add one more on a
 principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the
 great man expressed in another part of his work nor to have
 adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they
 subscribe with such ready acquiescence
when montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics the
 standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits
 of personal intrigue but it could never promote the greatness or
 happiness of the people of america
referring the examination of the principle itself to another
 place as has been already mentioned it will be sufficient to
 remark here that in the sense of the author who has been most
this form of government is a convention by which several
 smaller states agree to become members of a larger one which they
 intend to form it is a kind of assemblage of societies that
 constitute a new one capable of increasing by means of new
 associations till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be
as this government is composed of small republics it enjoys
 the internal happiness of each and with respect to its external
 situation it is possessed by means of the association of all the
 advantages of large monarchies
i have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting
 in the main arbitrary they are supported neither by principle nor
 precedent it has indeed happened that governments of this kind
 have generally operated in the manner which the distinction taken
 notice of supposes to be inherent in their nature but there have
 been in most of them extensive exceptions to the practice which
 a direct representation in the senate and leaves in their
 possession certain exclusive and very important portions of
 sovereign power this fully corresponds in every rational import
 of the terms with the idea of a federal government

friday november  
 modern cannot certainly be too much admired but it would be an
 unwarrantable partiality to contend that they have as effectually
 obviated the danger on this side as was wished and expected
 complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and
 virtuous citizens equally the friends of public and private faith
 a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations
by a faction i understand a number of citizens whether
 amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole who are united
 and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest
 adversed to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and
 at liberty to exercise it different opinions will be formed as
 long as the connection subsists between his reason and his
 selflove his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal
 influence on each other and the former will be objects to which
 the latter will attach themselves the diversity in the faculties
 turn divided mankind into parties inflamed them with mutual
 animosity and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress
 each other than to cooperate for their common good so strong is
 this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities that
 where no substantial occasion presents itself the most frivolous
 corrupt his integrity with equal nay with greater reason a body
 of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time
 yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation but so
 many judicial determinations not indeed concerning the rights of
 single persons but concerning the rights of large bodies of
 shilling with which they overburden the inferior number is a
 shilling saved to their own pockets
it is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to
 adjust these clashing interests and render them all subservient to
 the public good enlightened statesmen will not always be at the
 danger of such a faction and at the same time to preserve the
 spirit and the form of popular government is then the great object
 to which our inquiries are directed let me add that it is the
 great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued
 from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored and be
 interest will in almost every case be felt by a majority of the
 whole a communication and concert result from the form of
 government itself and there is nothing to check the inducements to
 sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual hence it is
 that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and
 latter to a small number of citizens elected by the rest
 secondly the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of
 country over which the latter may be extended
the effect of the first difference is on the one hand to
 refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the
 number in order to guard against the cabals of a few and that
 however large it may be they must be limited to a certain number
 in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude hence the
 number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion
 to that of the two constituents and being proportionally greater in
 render him unduly attached to these and too little fit to
 comprehend and pursue great and national objects the federal
 constitution forms a happy combination in this respect the great
 and aggregate interests being referred to the national the local
 and particular to the state legislatures
 act in unison with each other besides other impediments it may be
 remarked that where there is a consciousness of unjust or
 dishonorable purposes communication is always checked by distrust
 in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary
hence it clearly appears that the same advantage which a
 their particular states but will be unable to spread a general
 conflagration through the other states a religious sect may
 degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy
 but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must
 secure the national councils against any danger from that source a

the importance of the union in a commercial light is one of
 those points about which there is least room to entertain a
 difference of opinion and which has in fact commanded the most
 possible of an active commerce in our own bottoms this would
 answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their
 navigation of monopolizing the profits of our trade and of
 clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness
 did not prudence forbid the detail it would not be difficult to
 with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce from all our
 ports what would be the probable operation of this step upon her
 politics would it not enable us to negotiate with the fairest
 prospect of success for commercial privileges of the most valuable
 and extensive kind in the dominions of that kingdom when these
a mature consideration of the objects suggested by these
 questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to
 britain from such a state of things conspiring with the
 prepossessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the
 american trade and with the importunities of the west india
 in relation to operations in the west indies a few ships of the
 line sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side would
 often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign on the event
 of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended our
 position is in this respect a most commanding one and if to this
 on our property as often as it fell in their way the rights of
 neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an
 adequate power a nation despicable by its weakness forfeits even
 the privilege of being neutral
under a vigorous national government the natural strength and
 then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our
 commodities and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to
 enrich our enemies and p rsecutors that unequaled spirit of
 enterprise which signalizes the genius of the american merchants
 and navigators and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of
 natural than that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists
 such dangerous competitors
this branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial
 benefit all the navigating states may in different degrees
 advantageously participate in it and under circumstances of a
 of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture the
 difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy might be
 composed if chiefly constructed of southern wood would be of
 signal importance either in the view of naval strength or of
 national economy some of the southern and of the middle states
 foreign commerce it can be conducted upon much better terms with a
 large number of materials of a given value than with a small number
 of materials of the same value arising from the competitions of
 trade and from the fluctations of markets particular articles may
 be in great demand at certain periods and unsalable at others but
 placed of a striking and animating kind but they would lead us
 too far into the regions of futurity and would involve topics not
 proper for a newspaper discussion i shall briefly observe that
 our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an
 ascendant in the system of american affairs the world may
 another victim to his triumphs let americans disdain to be the
 instruments of european greatness let the thirteen states bound
 together in a strict and indissoluble union concur in erecting one
 great american system superior to the control of all transatlantic
 force or influence and able to dictate the terms of the connection
 gratification by promoting the introduction and circulation of the
 precious metals those darling objects of human avarice and
 enterprise it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of
 industry and to make them flow with greater activity and
 copiousness the assiduous merchant the laborious husbandman the
 it is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had an
 adversary and it is one among a multitude of proofs how apt a
 spirit of illinformed jealousy or of too great abstraction and
 refinement is to lead men astray from the plainest truths of reason
 and conviction
 will be seen to conduce to the purpose of revenue there are other
 points of view in which its influence will appear more immediate
 and decisive it is evident from the state of the country from the
 habits of the people from the experience we have had on the point
 itself that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums
 of this latter description
in america it is evident that we must a long time depend for
 the means of revenue chiefly on such duties in most parts of it
 excises must be confined within a narrow compass the genius of the
 people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of
 prejudice to trade
the relative situation of these states the number of rivers
 with which they are intersected and of bays that wash there shores
 the facility of communication in every direction the affinity of
 language and manners the familiar habits of intercourse all
 there is an inland communication and places in a strong light the
 disadvantages with which the collection of duties in this country
 would be encumbered if by disunion the states should be placed in a
 situation with respect to each other resembling that of france
 with respect to her neighbors the arbitrary and vexatious powers
 of its measures in each state would have a powerful tendency to
 render them effectual here also we should preserve by union an
 advantage which nature holds out to us and which would be
 relinquished by separation the united states lie at a great
 distance from europe and at a considerable distance from all other
 average exceeded in any state three per cent in france they are
 estimated to be about fifteen per cent and in britain they exceed
 this proportion there seems to be nothing to hinder their
 being increased in this country to at least treble their present
 amount the single article of ardent spirits under federal
 at all events in this country if the principal part be not drawn
 from commerce it must fall with oppressive weight upon land it
 has been already intimated that excises in their true
 signification are too little in unison with the feelings of the
 people to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation
 consistent with its respectability or its security thus we shall
 not even have the consolations of a full treasury to atone for the
 oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed
 in the cultivation of the soil but public and private distress
 will keep pace with each other in gloomy concert and unite in
 which would be necessary for a government of the whole the entire
 separation of the states into thirteen unconnected sovereignties is
 a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have many
 advocates the ideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of
 the empire seem generally turned toward three confederaciesone
 people and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to
 direct the passions of so large a society to the public good we
 shall see no reason to doubt that the like portion of power would be
 sufficient to perform the same task in a society far more numerous
 civil power properly organized and exerted is capable of
 other obvious reasons that would facilitate her accession to it
 new jersey is too small a state to think of being a frontier in
 opposition to this still more powerful combination nor do there
 appear to be any obstacles to her admission into it even
 pennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the northern
nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen states will
 be able to support a national government better than one half or
 one third or any number less than the whole this reflection must
 have great weight in obviating that objection to the proposed plan
 which is founded on the principle of expense an objection

to the people of the state of new york
the error which limits republican government to a narrow
 district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers i
 remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence
 chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy applying
 to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter the
 that it can never be established but among a small number of people
 living within a small compass of territory
such a fallacy may have been the less perceived as most of the
 popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic species
 and even in modern europe to which we owe the great principle of
 barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be

 fellowcitizens to place before you in a clear and convincing
 light the importance of union to your political safety and
in pursuance of the plan which i have laid down for the

 reasoning or proof to illustrate a position which is not either
 last stage of national humiliation there is scarcely anything that

 lowest point of declension is respectability in the eyes of
 foreign powers a safeguard against foreign encroachments the

 complete independence in the members they still in fine seem to
 cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an imperium
 in imperio this renders a full display of the principal defects
 of the confederation necessary in order to show that the evils we
 experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections but
 which the states observe or disregard at their option
it is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human
 mind that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on
 this head there should still be found men who object to the new
 constitution for deviating from a principle which has been found

 direction of a common council we must resolve to incorporate into

 characteristic difference between a league and a government we
 must extend the authority of the union to the persons of the

it remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government
 in its application to us would even be capable of answering its end 
 if there should not be a large army constantly at the disposal of
 the national government it would either not be able to employ force
 chargeable with any violation or omission of duty this would be
 the more likely to take place as the delinquencies of the larger
 members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious
 premeditation in their rulers with a view to getting rid of all
 external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement the
 of this country that the complying states would often be inclined
 to support the authority of the union by engaging in a war against
 the noncomplying states they would always be more ready to pursue
 the milder course of putting themselves upon an equal footing with
 the delinquent members by an imitation of their example and the
 by the instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to
 execute the ordinary requisitions or decrees of the government and
 yet this is the plain alternative involved by those who wish to deny
 it the power of extending its operations to individuals such a
 scheme if practicable at all would instantly degenerate into a
 sovereign states supported by military coercion has never been
 found effectual it has rarely been attempted to be employed but
 against the weaker members and in most instances attempts to
 coerce the refractory and disobedient have been the signals of
 bloody wars in which one half of the confederacy has displayed its
 possess all the means and have aright to resort to all the methods
 of executing the powers with which it is intrusted that are
 possessed and exercised by the government of the particular states
to this reasoning it may perhaps be objected that if any state
 should be disaffected to the authority of the union it could at any
 they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens
 themselves the particular governments could not interrupt their
 progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional
 power no omissions nor evasions would answer the end they would
 be obliged to act and in such a manner as would leave no doubt that
 exercise of the federal authority
if opposition to the national government should arise from the
 disorderly conduct of refractory or seditious individuals it could
 be overcome by the same means which are daily employed against the
 same evil under the state governments the magistracy being
 them it is in vain to hope to guard against events too mighty for
 human foresight or precaution and it would be idle to object to a
 government because it could not perform impossibilities

 stronger bias towards their local governments than towards the

 be destroyed by a much better administration of the latter

there is no method of steering clear of this inconvenience but
 by authorizing the national government to raise its own revenues in

 anticipated under the first head of our inquiries and for this
 reason as well as from the universal conviction entertained upon

 evident on the most superficial view that there is no object
 provisions in former bills had been found to answer every purpose to

several states have endeavored by separate prohibitions
 through their territories by means of which the fine streams and
 navigable rivers with which germany is so happily watered are
 rendered almost useless though the genius of the people of this

 applicable to us yet we may reasonably expect from the gradual
 expense continual fluctuations in the troops ruinous to their
 discipline and subjecting the public safety frequently to the
 perilous crisis of a disbanded army hence also those oppressive
 expedients for raising men which were upon several occasions
 practiced and which nothing but the enthusiasm of liberty would

 injustice among the members
the right of equal suffrage among the states is another
 exceptionable part of the confederation every idea of proportion
 revolt from the idea of receiving the law from the smaller to
 acquiesce in such a privation of their due importance in the
 political scale would be not merely to be insensible to the love of
 power but even to sacrifice the desire of equality it is neither
 rational to expect the first nor just to require the last the
 magnitude in addition to this it is to be observed that there is
 a probability of an increase in the number of states and no
 provision for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes
but this is not all what at first sight may seem a remedy is
 in reality a poison to give a minority a negative upon the
 respectable majority in those emergencies of a nation in which
 the goodness or badness the weakness or strength of its government
 is of the greatest importance there is commonly a necessity for
 action the public business must in some way or other go forward
 if a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority
 decide though the contrary of this has been presumed the mistake
 has proceeded from not attending with due care to the mischiefs that
 may be occasioned by obstructing the progress of government at
 certain critical seasons when the concurrence of a large number is
 required by the constitution to the doing of any national act we
 a greater number upon the same principle it would be much easier
 for a foreign power with which we were at war to perplex our
 councils and embarrass our exertions and in a commercial view we
 may be subjected to similar inconveniences a nation with which we
 might have a treaty of commerce could with much greater facility
 trust which to any but minds animated and guided by superior
 virtue may appear to exceed the proportion of interest they have in
 the common stock and to overbalance the obligations of duty hence
 it is that history furnishes us with so many mortifying examples of
 the prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments how

 pieces in spite of our illjudged efforts to prop it or by
 successive augmentations of its force an energy as necessity might
 prompt we shall finally accumulate in a single body all the most
 possibility of a question of this nature proves the necessity of

the necessity of a constitution at least equally energetic with
 the one proposed to the preservation of the union is the point at
 the examination of which we are now arrived
this inquiry will naturally divide itself into three
 of national exigencies or the correspondent extent and variety of
 the means which may be necessary to satisfy them the circumstances
 that endanger the safety of nations are infinite and for this
 reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power
 to which the care of it is committed this power ought to be
 affect the public safety are reducible within certain determinate
 limits unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and
 rationally disputed it must be admitted as a necessary
 consequence that there can be no limitation of that authority which
 is to provide for the defense and protection of the community in
 the duty of the members to the federal head
the experiment has however demonstrated that this expectation
 was illfounded and illusory and the observations made under the
 last head will i imagine have sufficed to convince the impartial
 and discerning that there is an absolute necessity for an entire
 allowing to each the most ample authority for fulfilling the
 objects committed to its charge shall the union be constituted the
 guardian of the common safety are fleets and armies and revenues
 necessary to this purpose the government of the union must be
 empowered to pass all laws and to make all regulations which have
 interested in the preservation of every part which from the
 responsibility implied in the duty assigned to it will be most
 sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper exertions and
 which by the extension of its authority throughout the states can
 alone establish uniformity and concert in the plans and measures by
 its being safely vested with the requisite powers if any plan
 which has been or may be offered to our consideration should not
 upon a dispassionate inspection be found to answer this
 description it ought to be rejected a government the
 constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the

 moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration
 turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the legislative
 authority of the nation in the article of military establishments
 a principle unheard of except in one or two of our state
 respect to this object an important qualification even of the
 legislative discretion in that clause which forbids the
 appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer
 period than two years a precaution which upon a nearer view of it
 will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up
still however he would be persuaded that there must be some
 plausible foundation for the cry raised on this head he would
 never be able to imagine while any source of information remained
 unexplored that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the
 public credulity dictated either by a deliberate intention to

 or ardent temper he could now no longer refrain from regarding
 these clamors as the dishonest artifices of a sinister and
 unprincipled opposition to a plan which ought at least to receive a
 fair and candid examination from all sincere lovers of their
 precedents among ourselves it may be satisfactory to take a nearer
 view of its intrinsic merits from a close examination it will
 appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in
 respect to military establishments in time of peace would be
 improper to be imposed and if imposed from the necessities of
 future concert of views between these nations ought not to be
 regarded as improbable the increasing remoteness of consanguinity
 is every day diminishing the force of the family compact between
 france and spain and politicians have ever with great reason
 considered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of
 pursuits of individuals would form conclusive objections to the
 scheme it would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as
 ruinous to private citizens the latter resource of permanent corps
 in the pay of the government amounts to a standing army in time of
 peace a small one indeed but not the less real for being small

 powers to act this part would be to desert all the usual maxims of

 the matter no bills of rights appear annexed to the constitutions
 it would in practice transfer the care of the common defense from
 the federal head to the individual members a project oppressive to
 some states dangerous to all and baneful to the confederacy
the territories of britain spain and of the indian nations in
 our neighborhood do not border on particular states but encircle
 provisions should be proportionally enlarged the other states would
 quickly take the alarm at seeing the whole military force of the
 union in the hands of two or three of its members and those
 probably amongst the most powerful they would each choose to have
 some counterpoise and pretenses could easily be contrived in this
 forces in the hands of the national government as far as an army
 may be considered as a dangerous weapon of power it had better be
 in those hands of which the people are most likely to be jealous
 than in those of which they are least likely to be jealous for it
 is a truth which the experience of ages has attested that the
 designed the prohibition should extend whether to raising armies
 as well as to keeping them up in a season of tranquillity or not
 if it be confined to the latter it will have no precise
 signification and it will be ineffectual for the purpose intended
 when armies are once raised what shall be denominated keeping
the supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be
 founded on the supposed probability or at least possibility of a
 combination between the executive and the legislative in some
 scheme of usurpation should this at any time happen how easy
 would it be to fabricate pretenses of approaching danger indian
 levies of men for the protection of the state we must receive the
 blow before we could even prepare to return it all that kind of
 policy by which nations anticipate distant danger and meet the
 gathering storm must be abstained from as contrary to the genuine
 maxims of a free government we must expose our property and
 valor on numerous occasions erected eternal monuments to their
 fame but the bravest of them feel and know that the liberty of
 their country could not have been established by their efforts
 alone however great and valuable they were war like most other
 things is a science to be acquired and perfected by diligence by
 massachusetts opposed no obstacle to the measure but the instance
 is still of use to instruct us that cases are likely to occur under
 our government as well as under those of other nations which will
 sometimes render a military force in time of peace essential to the
 security of the society and that it is therefore improper in this
 domestic examples which is that nations pay little regard to
 rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to
 the necessities of society wise politicians will be cautious about
 fettering the government with restrictions that cannot be observed
 because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws though
 rights a failure in this delicate and important point is the great
 source of the inconveniences we experience and if we are not
 cautious to avoid a repetition of the error in our future attempts
 to rectify and ameliorate our system we may travel from one
 chimerical project to another we may try change after change but
 propriety of correcting any extremes into which we may have
 heretofore run they appear disposed to conduct us into others still
 more dangerous and more extravagant as if the tone of government
 had been found too high or too rigid the doctrines they teach are
 calculated to induce us to depress or to relax it by expedients
 to those habits of thinking which we derive from the nation from
 whom the inhabitants of these states have in general sprung
in england for a long time after the norman conquest the
 authority of the monarch was almost unlimited inroads were
 gradually made upon the prerogative in favor of liberty first by
 the mere authority of the executive magistrate the patriots who
 effected that memorable revolution were too temperate too
 wellinformed to think of any restraint on the legislative
 discretion they were aware that a certain number of troops for
 guards and garrisons were indispensable that no precise bounds
 hereditary monarch were by an injudicious excess extended to the
 representatives of the people in their popular assemblies even in
 some of the states where this error was not adopted we find
 unnecessary declarations that standing armies ought not to be kept
 up in time of peace without the consent of the legislature i
 up but that they ought not to be kept up in time of peace this
 ambiguity of terms appears to have been the result of a conflict
 between jealousy and conviction between the desire of excluding
 such establishments at all events and the persuasion that an
 absolute exclusion would be unwise and unsafe
 operation
the legislature of the united states will be obliged by this
 provision once at least in every two years to deliberate upon the
 propriety of keeping a military force on foot to come to a new
 resolution on the point and to declare their sense of the matter
 only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of
 the citizens against encroachments from the federal government will
 constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national
 rulers and will be ready enough if any thing improper appears to
 sound the alarm to the people and not only to be the voice but if
 such presumptions can fairly be made there ought at once to be an
 end of all delegated authority the people should resolve to recall
 all the powers they have heretofore parted with out of their own
 hands and to divide themselves into as many states as there are
 counties in order that they may be able to manage their own
 possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace if we
 suppose it to have been created in consequence of some domestic
 insurrection or foreign war then it becomes a case not within the
 principles of the objection for this is levelled against the power
 of keeping up troops in time of peace few persons will be so
 militia which ought always to be counted upon as a valuable and
 powerful auxiliary but in a state of disunion as has been fully
 shown in another place the contrary of this supposition would
 become not only probable but almost unavoidable
publius
 disinclined to the exercise of federal authority in any matter of an
 internal nature waiving any exception that might be taken to the
 inaccuracy or inexplicitness of the distinction between internal and
 external let us inquire what ground there is to presuppose that
 disinclination in the people unless we presume at the same time
 that through the medium of the state legislatures which are select
 bodies of men and which are to appoint the members of the national
 senate there is reason to expect that this branch will generally be
 composed with peculiar care and judgment that these circumstances
 promise greater knowledge and more extensive information in the
 need of any other methods to enforce their execution than the laws
 of the particular members
the hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition the
 dread of punishment a proportionably strong discouragement to it
 will not the government of the union which if possessed of a due
 their feelings the further it enters into those objects which touch
 the most sensible chords and put in motion the most active springs
 of the human heart the greater will be the probability that it will
 conciliate the respect and attachment of the community man is very
 much a creature of habit a thing that rarely strikes his senses
 shown that in such a confederacy there can be no sanction for the
 laws but force that frequent delinquencies in the members are the
 natural offspring of the very frame of the government and that as
 often as these happen they can only be redressed if at all by war
 and violence
 thus the legislatures courts and magistrates of the respective
 members will be incorporated into the operations of the national
 government as far as its just and constitutional authority extends
 and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws 
 any man who will pursue by his own reflections the consequences
 in its proper place be fully detected
federalist no 
the same subject continued
the idea of restraining the legislative authority in regard to
 the common defense considered
 government there could be no remedy but force the means to be
 employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief if it
 should be a slight commotion in a small part of a state the militia
 of the residue would be adequate to its suppression and the
 national presumption is that they would be ready to do their duty
 enterprise from the efforts of the militia alone would she not
 have been compelled to raise and to maintain a more regular force
 for the execution of her design if it must then be admitted that
 the necessity of recurring to a force different from the militia in
 cases of this extraordinary nature is applicable to the state
 these happened be obliged to have recourse to the same expedients
 for upholding its authority which are objected to in a government
 for all the states would the militia in this supposition be more
 ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case
 of a general union all candid and intelligent men must upon due
if the representatives of the people betray their constituents
 there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original
 right of selfdefense which is paramount to all positive forms of
 government and which against the usurpations of the national
 rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success
 popular resistance
the obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance
 increase with the increased extent of the state provided the
 citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them
 the natural strength of the people in a large community in
 the national authority projects of usurpation cannot be masked
 under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies
 of men as of the people at large the legislatures will have
 better means of information they can discover the danger at a
 distance and possessing all the organs of civil power and the
 at all events be regulated by the resources of the country for a
 long time to come it will not be possible to maintain a large army
 and as the means of doing this increase the population and natural
 strength of the community will proportionably increase when will
 the time arrive that the federal government can raise and maintain
 services in times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents
 to the duties of superintending the common defense and of watching
 over the internal peace of the confederacy
it requires no skill in the science of war to discern that
 uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would
of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to
 the plan of the convention there is none that was so little to have
 been expected or is so untenable in itself as the one from which
 this particular provision has been attacked if a wellregulated
 militia be the most natural defense of a free country it ought
 calling out the posse comitatus to assist the magistrate in the
 execution of his duty whence it has been inferred that military
 force was intended to be his only auxiliary there is a striking
 incoherence in the objections which have appeared and sometimes
 even from the same quarter not much calculated to inspire a very
 conclusion which has been drawn from it in its application to the
 authority of the federal government over the militia is as uncandid
 as it is illogical what reason could there be to infer that force
 was intended to be the sole instrument of authority merely because
 there is a power to make use of it when necessary what shall we
 states is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of
 being carried into execution a tolerable expertness in military
 movements is a business that requires time and practice it is not
 a day or even a week that will suffice for the attainment of it
 to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes
but though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be
 abandoned as mischievous or impracticable yet it is a matter of
 the utmost importance that a welldigested plan should as soon as
 possible be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia
 the attention of the government ought particularly to be directed
 of safety from the very sources which they represent as fraught with
 danger and perdition but how the national legislature may reason
 on the point is a thing which neither they nor i can foresee
there is something so farfetched and so extravagant in the idea
 of danger to liberty from the militia that one is at a loss whether
 extinguish it there can be no doubt that this circumstance will
 always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia
in reading many of the publications against the constitution a
 man is apt to imagine that he is perusing some illwritten tale or
 romance which instead of natural and agreeable images exhibits to
 their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon the
 people of america for infallible truths
if there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of
 despotism what need of the militia if there should be no army
 whither would the militia irritated by being called upon to
 believe that they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish
 their designs
in times of insurrection or invasion it would be natural and
 proper that the militia of a neighboring state should be marched
 into another to resist a common enemy or to guard the republic
 to possess the power of providing for the support of the national
 forces in which proposition was intended to be included the
 expense of raising troops of building and equipping fleets and all
 other expenses in any wise connected with military arrangements and
 operations but these are not the only objects to which the
 for a more eligible mode of supplying the public wants or the
 government must sink into a fatal atrophy and in a short course of
 time perish
in the ottoman or turkish empire the sovereign though in other
 respects absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects
 any sums of money necessary in their judgment to the service of
 the united states and their requisitions if conformable to the
 rule of apportionment are in every constitutional sense obligatory
 upon the states these have no right to question the propriety of
 the demand no discretion beyond that of devising the ways and
 permitting the national government to raise its own revenues by the
 ordinary methods of taxation authorized in every wellordered
 constitution of civil government ingenious men may declaim with
 plausibility on any subject but no human ingenuity can point out
 any other expedient to rescue us from the inconveniences and
 plan of extinguishment which a man moderately impressed with the
 importance of public justice and public credit could approve in
 addition to the establishments which all parties will acknowledge to
 be necessary we could not reasonably flatter ourselves that this
 resource alone upon the most improved scale would even suffice for
 seeds of discord and contention between the federal head and its
 members and between the members themselves can it be expected
 that the deficiencies would be better supplied in this mode than the
 total wants of the union have heretofore been supplied in the same
 mode it ought to be recollected that if less will be required from
 execute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good
let us attend to what would be the effects of this situation in
 the very first war in which we should happen to be engaged we will
 presume for arguments sake that the revenue arising from the
 impost duties answers the purposes of a provision for the public
 would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing
 by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the
 steadiness of its measures for paying the loans it might be able
 to procure would be as limited in their extent as burdensome in
 their conditions they would be made upon the same principles that
 depend upon thirteen other governments for the means of fulfilling
 its contracts when once its situation is clearly understood would
 require a degree of credulity not often to be met with in the
 pecuniary transactions of mankind and little reconcilable with the
 usual sharpsightedness of avarice
in disquisitions of every kind there are certain primary
 truths or first principles upon which all subsequent reasonings
 must depend these contain an internal evidence which antecedent
 to all reflection or combination commands the assent of the mind
 where it produces not this effect it must proceed either from some
 degree of force and conviction almost equally irresistible
the objects of geometrical inquiry are so entirely abstracted
 from those pursuits which stir up and put in motion the unruly
 passions of the human heart that mankind without difficulty adopt
 not only the more simple theorems of the science but even those
 certainty with those of the mathematics yet they have much better
 claims in this respect than to judge from the conduct of men in
 particular situations we should be disposed to allow them the
 obscurity is much oftener in the passions and prejudices of the
 reasoner than in the subject men upon too many occasions do not
 the sense of the people
as the duties of superintending the national defense and of
 securing the public peace against foreign or domestic violence
 involve a provision for casualties and dangers to which no possible
 limits can be assigned the power of making that provision ought to
 antagonists of the proposed constitution so far from acquiescing in
 their justness or truth seem to make their principal and most
 zealous effort against this part of the plan it may therefore be
 satisfactory to analyze the arguments with which they combat it
those of them which have been most labored with that view seem
 government might at any time abolish the taxes imposed for state
 objects upon the pretense of an interference with its own it might
 allege a necessity of doing this in order to give efficacy to the
 national revenues and thus all the resources of taxation might by
 degrees become the subjects of federal monopoly to the entire
 and irresolution i repeat here what i have observed in substance
 in another place that all observations founded upon the danger of
 usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of
 the government not to the nature or extent of its powers the
 state governments by their original constitutions are invested
 commonly possess most influence over them the natural conclusion is
 that such contests will be most apt to end to the disadvantage of
 the union and that there is greater probability of encroachments
 by the members upon the federal head than by the federal head upon
 the members but it is evident that all conjectures of this kind

to the people of the state of new york
although i am of opinion that there would be no real danger of
 the consequences which seem to be apprehended to the state
an entire consolidation of the states into one complete national
 sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the parts and
 whatever powers might remain in them would be altogether dependent
 on the general will but as the plan of the convention aims only at
 a partial union or consolidation the state governments would
 jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the
 following instances the last clause but one in the eighth section
 of the first article provides expressly that congress shall exercise
 exclusive legislation over the district to be appropriated as
 the seat of government this answers to the first case the first
a case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter but
 which is in fact widely different affects the question immediately
 under consideration i mean the power of imposing taxes on all
 articles other than exports and imports this i contend is
 manifestly a concurrent and coequal authority in the united states
 which if the reasoning of the objectors be just could not have
 been intended i mean that the states in all cases to which the
 restriction did not apply would have a concurrent power of taxation
 with the union the restriction in question amounts to what lawyers
 call a negative pregnant that is a negation of one thing and an
 of taxation upon the union it is evident that this could not have
 been the intention and that it will not bear a construction of the
 kind
as to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of taxation
 in the states and in the union it cannot be supported in that sense
 all authorities of which the states are not explicitly divested in
 favor of the union remain with them in full vigor is not a
 theoretical consequence of that division but is clearly admitted by
 the whole tenor of the instrument which contains the articles of the
 proposed constitution we there find that notwithstanding the
to the people of the state of new york
the residue of the argument against the provisions of the
 constitution in respect to taxation is ingrafted upon the following
 clause the last clause of the eighth section of the first article
 of the plan under consideration authorizes the national legislature
 happened to contemplate them in the same light it may be affirmed
 with perfect confidence that the constitutional operation of the
 intended government would be precisely the same if these clauses
 were entirely obliterated as if they were repeated in every article
 they are only declaratory of a truth which would have resulted by
 conducts us to this palpable truth that a power to lay and collect
 taxes must be a power to pass all laws necessary and proper for the
 execution of that power and what does the unfortunate and
 culumniated provision in question do more than declare the same
 truth to wit that the national legislature to whom the power of
 is that it could only have been done for greater caution and to
 guard against all cavilling refinements in those who might hereafter
 feel a disposition to curtail and evade the legitimatb authorities
 of the union the convention probably foresaw what it has been a
 principal aim of these papers to inculcate that the danger which
 authority and make a tyrannical use of its powers the people whose
 creature it is must appeal to the standard they have formed and
 take such measures to redress the injury done to the constitution as
 the exigency may suggest and prudence justify the propriety of a
 law in a constitutional light must always be determined by the
 law of the land but what inference can be drawn from this or what
 would they amount to if they were not to be supreme it is evident
 they would amount to nothing a law by the very meaning of the
 term includes supremacy it is a rule which those to whom it is
 prescribed are bound to observe this results from every political
 immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal
 government it will not i presume have escaped observation that
 it expressly confines this supremacy to laws made pursuant to the
 constitution which i mention merely as an instance of caution in
 the convention since that limitation would have been to be
 and uncontrollable authority to raise revenue to any extent of which
 they may stand in need by every kind of taxation except duties on
 imports and exports it will be shown in the next paper that this
 concurrent jurisdiction in the article of taxation was the only
 admissible substitute for an entire subordination in respect to
 independent of all external control that the field is sufficiently
 wide will more fully appear when we come to advert to the
 inconsiderable share of the public expenses for which it will fall
 to the lot of the state governments to provide
to argue upon abstract principles that this coordinate
 as to give a superiority to the patrician interest in the latter
 in which numbers prevailed the plebian interest had an entire
 predominancy and yet these two legislatures coexisted for ages
 and the roman republic attained to the utmost height of human
 greatness
 the present period but to look forward to remote futurity
 constitutions of civil government are not to be framed upon a
 calculation of existing exigencies but upon a combination of these
 with the probable exigencies of ages according to the natural and
 tried course of human affairs nothing therefore can be more
 of providing for emergencies as they may arise though it is easy
 to assert in general terms the possibility of forming a rational
 judgment of a due provision against probable dangers yet we may
 safely challenge those who make the assertion to bring forward their
 data and may affirm that they would be found as vague and uncertain
 entirely out of its reach or if the combustible materials that now
 seem to be collecting should be dissipated without coming to
 maturity or if a flame should be kindled without extending to us
 what security can we have that our tranquillity will long remain
 undisturbed from some other cause or from some other quarter let
 are necessary to guard the body politic against these two most
 mortal diseases of society the expenses arising from those
 institutions which are relative to the mere domestic police of a
 state to the support of its legislative executive and judicial
 departments with their different appendages and to the
 administration and the frugality and economy which in that
 particular become the modest simplicity of republican government
 if we balance a proper deduction from one side against that which
 it is supposed ought to be made from the other the proportion may
 still be considered as holding good
 calculate not on temporary but on permanent causes of expense if
 this principle be a just one our attention would be directed to a
 provision in favor of the state governments for an annual sum of
 about two hundred thousand pounds while the exigencies of the
 union could be susceptible of no limits even in imagination in
 command of two thirds of the resources of the community to defray
 from a tenth to a twentieth part of its expenses and to the union
 one third of the resources of the community to defray from nine
 tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expenses if we desert this
 boundary and content ourselves with leaving to the states an
 jurisdiction preferable to that subordination and it is evident
 that it has at least the merit of reconciling an indefinite
 constitutional power of taxation in the federal government with an
 adequate and independent power in the states to provide for their
 own necessities there remain a few other lights in which this
 the several states as among the citizens of the same state
suppose as has been contended for the federal power of
 taxation were to be confined to duties on imports it is evident
 that the government for want of being able to command other
 resources would frequently be tempted to extend these duties to an
 overstocked a great proportion falls upon the merchant and
 sometimes not only exhausts his profits but breaks in upon his
 capital i am apt to think that a division of the duty between the
 seller and the buyer more often happens than is commonly imagined
 it is not always possible to raise the price of a commodity in
 would be attended with inequality from a different cause between
 the manufacturing and the nonmanufacturing states the states
 which can go farthest towards the supply of their own wants by
 their own manufactures will not according to their numbers or
 wealth consume so great a proportion of imported articles as those
 would be the case as long as other resources were open but if the
 avenues to them were closed hope stimulated by necessity would
 beget experiments fortified by rigorous precautions and additional
 penalties which for a time would have the intended effect till
 there had been leisure to contrive expedients to elude these new
 well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of those to whom it is
 addressed but when we come to dissect it with attention it will
 appear to be made up of nothing but fairsounding words the object
 it seems to aim at is in the first place impracticable and in the
 sense in which it is contended for is unnecessary i reserve for
 natural patron and friend and they are aware that however great
 the confidence they may justly feel in their own good sense their
 interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by
 themselves they are sensible that their habits in life have not
 been such as to give them those acquired endowments without which
nothing remains but the landed interest and this in a
 political view and particularly in relation to taxes i take to be
 perfectly united from the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest
 tenant no tax can be laid on land which will not affect the
 proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a
it is said to be necessary that all classes of citizens should
 have some of their own number in the representative body in order
 that their feelings and interests may be the better understood and
 attended to but we have seen that this will never happen under any
 arrangement that leaves the votes of the people free where this is
 to the general interests of the society
if we take into the account the momentary humors or dispositions
 which may happen to prevail in particular parts of the society and
 to which a wise administration will never be inattentive is the man
 whose situation leads to extensive inquiry and information less
 to resort to oppressive expedients or sacrifice any particular
 class of citizens to the procurement of revenue it might be
 demonstrated that the most productive system of finance will always
 be the least burdensome there can be no doubt that in order to a
 judicious exercise of the power of taxation it is necessary that
we have seen that the result of the observations to which the
 foregoing number has been principally devoted is that from the
 natural operation of the different interests and views of the
 various classes of the community whether the representation of the
 people be more or less numerous it will consist almost entirely of
 all lead to the same result and in particular it might be asked
 what greater affinity or relation of interest can be conceived
 between the carpenter and blacksmith and the linen manufacturer or
 stocking weaver than between the merchant and either of them it
 is notorious that there are often as great rivalships between
 destitute of foundation if any question is depending in a state
 legislature respecting one of the counties which demands a
 knowledge of local details how is it acquired no doubt from the
 information of the members of the county cannot the like knowledge
 be obtained in the national legislature from the representatives of
inquisitive and enlightened statesmen are deemed everywhere best
 qualified to make a judicious selection of the objects proper for
 revenue which is a clear indication as far as the sense of
 mankind can have weight in the question of the species of knowledge
 of local circumstances requisite to the purposes of taxation
 each this could always be known from the respective codes of laws
 as well as from the information of the members from the several
 states
the objection when applied to real property or to houses and
 lands appears to have at first sight more foundation but even in
but there is a simple point of view in which this matter may be
 placed that must be altogether satisfactory the national
 legislature can make use of the system of each state within that
 state the method of laying and collecting this species of taxes in
 each state can in all its parts be adopted and employed by the
 stead by way of answer to this it has been triumphantly asked
 why not in the first instance omit that ambiguous power and rely
 upon the latter resource two solid answers may be given the
 first is that the exercise of that power if convenient will be
 preferable because it will be more effectual and it is impossible
 where there is an immediate common interest we may safely count
 upon its operation when the particular debts of the states are
 done away and their expenses come to be limited within their
 natural compass the possibility almost of interference will vanish
 a small land tax will answer the purpose of the states and will be
 imposition this will best answer the views of revenue because it
 will save expense in the collection and will best avoid any
 occasion of disgust to the state governments and to the people at
 all events here is a practicable expedient for avoiding such an
 inconvenience and nothing more can be required than to show that
 if to be done by the authority of the federal government it will
 not be to be done by that of the state government the quantity of
 taxes to be paid by the community must be the same in either case
 with this advantage if the provision is to be made by the
 union that the capital resource of commercial imposts which is the
as to poll taxes i without scruple confess my disapprobation
 of them and though they have prevailed from an early period in
 those states  which have uniformly been the most tenacious of
 their rights i should lament to see them introduced into practice
 under the national government but does it follow because there is
 the national councils in this respect there may exist certain
 critical and tempestuous conjunctures of the state in which a poll
 tax may become an inestimable resource and as i know nothing to
 exempt this portion of the globe from the common calamities that
 have befallen other parts of it i acknowledge my aversion to every

concerning the difficulties of the convention in devising a proper
 form of government
 place be indulged which candor previously suggests
it is a misfortune inseparable from human affairs that public
 measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation
 which is essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to
 advance or obstruct the public good and that this spirit is more
 be a material difference in the purity of their intentions it is
 but just to remark in favor of the latter description that as our
 situation is universally admitted to be peculiarly critical and to
 require indispensably that something should be done for our relief
 the predetermined patron of what has been actually done may have
 liable but will keep in mind that they themselves also are but
 men and ought not to assume an infallibility in rejudging the
 fallible opinions of others
with equal readiness will it be perceived that besides these
 inducements to candor many allowances ought to be made for the
among the difficulties encountered by the convention a very
 important one must have lain in combining the requisite stability
 and energy in government with the inviolable attention due to
 liberty and to the republican form without substantially
 accomplishing this part of their undertaking they would have very
 the state administrations on comparing however these valuable
 ingredients with the vital principles of liberty we must perceive
 at once the difficulty of mingling them together in their due
 proportions the genius of republican liberty seems to demand on
 one side not only that all power should be derived from the people
 the state governments every man will be sensible of this
 difficulty in proportion as he has been accustomed to contemplate
 and discriminate objects extensive and complicated in their nature
 the faculties of the mind itself have never yet been distinguished
 and defined with satisfactory precision by all the efforts of the
 delineations are perfectly accurate and appear to be otherwise only
 from the imperfection of the eye which surveys them to the
 institutions of man in which the obscurity arises as well from the
 object itself as from the organ by which it is contemplated we must
 perceive the necessity of moderating still further our expectations

 the jurisdiction of her several courts general and local of law
 of equity of admiralty etc is not less a source of frequent and
 intricate discussions sufficiently denoting the indeterminate
 limits by which they are respectively circumscribed all new laws
 inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered and this
 unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less according to the
 complexity and novelty of the objects defined when the almighty
 himself condescends to address mankind in their own language his
 meaning luminous as it must be is rendered dim and doubtful by the
 extremely probable also that after the ratio of representation had
 been adjusted this very compromise must have produced a fresh
 struggle between the same parties to give such a turn to the
 organization of the government and to the distribution of its
 powers as would increase the importance of the branches in forming
 administration of the government when formed yet every one must be
 sensible of the contrary influence which must have been experienced
 in the task of forming it
would it be wonderful if under the pressure of all these
 difficulties the convention should have been forced into some
 opinions assuaging their mutual jealousies and adjusting their
 respective interests is a history of factions contentions and
 disappointments and may be classed among the most dark and degraded
 pictures which display the infirmities and depravities of the human
 character if in a few scattered instances a brighter aspect is

 ratification of the senate and people this remark is applicable to
 confederate governments also amphictyon we are told was the
 author of that which bore his name the achaean league received its
 first birth from achaeus and its second from aratus
what degree of agency these reputed lawgivers might have in
 whence could it have proceeded that the athenians a people who
 would not suffer an army to be commanded by fewer than ten generals
 and who required no other proof of danger to their liberties than
 the illustrious merit of a fellowcitizen should consider one
 illustrious citizen as a more eligible depositary of the fortunes of
 the improvement made by america on the ancient mode of preparing and
 establishing regular plans of government they serve not less on
 the other to admonish us of the hazards and difficulties incident
 to such experiments and of the great imprudence of unnecessarily
 multiplying them
 is abundant reason nevertheless to suppose that immaterial as
 these objections were they would have been adhered to with a very
 dangerous inflexibility in some states had not a zeal for their
 opinions and supposed interests been stifled by the more powerful
 sentiment of selfpreservation one state we may remember
 may be made to issue in an improvement of his constitution they
 are equally unanimous in prescribing the remedy by which this happy
 effect is to be produced the prescription is no sooner made known
 however than a number of persons interpose and without denying
 the reality or danger of the disorder assure the patient that the
 objections to the remedy proposed or in the proper one to be
 substituted let them speak for themselves this one tells us that
 the proposed constitution ought to be rejected because it is not a
 confederation of the states but a government over individuals
 another admits that it ought to be a government over individuals to
 that the congress will be but a shadow of a representation and that
 the government would be far less objectionable if the number and the
 expense were doubled a patriot in a state that does not import or
 export discerns insuperable objections against the power of direct
 taxation the patriotic adversary in a state of great exports and
 his particular explanation and scarce any two are exactly agreed
 upon the subject in the eyes of one the junction of the senate
 with the president in the responsible function of appointing to
 offices instead of vesting this executive power in the executive
 alone is the vicious part of the organization to another the
 discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be constituted
 the demand of one gentleman is that the council should consist of
 a small number to be appointed by the most numerous branch of the
 legislature another would prefer a larger number and considers it
 as a fundamental condition that the appointment should be made by
 their own deliberations and whether the constitution now before
 the public would not stand as fair a chance for immortality as
 lycurgus gave to that of sparta by making its change to depend on
 his own return from exile and death if it were to be immediately
 adopted and were to continue in force not until a better but
 federal government the present congress can make requisitions to
 any amount they please and the states are constitutionally bound to
 furnish them they can emit bills of credit as long as they will
 pay for the paper they can borrow both abroad and at home as
 long as a shilling will be lent is an indefinite power to raise
i shall be told that however dangerous this mixture of powers
 may be in theory it is rendered harmless by the dependence of
 congress on the state for the means of carrying them into practice
 that however large the mass of powers may be it is in fact a
 lifeless mass then say i in the first place that the
 discharge of the domestic debt and to furnish for a certain
 period liberal tributes to the federal treasury a very large
 proportion of this fund has been already surrendered by individual
 states and it may with reason be expected that the remaining
 states will not persist in withholding similar proofs of their
 the new system the objections which we have heard would they not
 act with more consistency in urging the establishment of the
 latter as no less necessary to guard the union against the future
 powers and resources of a body constructed like the existing
 congress than to save it from the dangers threatened by the present
 meant to introduce a candid survey of the plan of government
 reported by the convention we now proceed to the execution of that
 part of our undertaking
the first question that offers itself is whether the general
 form and aspect of the government be strictly republican it is
 by a small body of hereditary nobles poland which is a mixture of
 aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms has been dignified
 with the same appellation the government of england which has one
 republican branch only combined with an hereditary aristocracy and
 monarchy has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the
 appointed either directly or indirectly by the people and that
 they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just
 specified otherwise every government in the united states as well
 as every other popular government that has been or can be well
 organized or well executed would be degraded from the republican
 that of one branch at least of all the state legislatures is
 elected immediately by the great body of the people the senate
 like the present congress and the senate of maryland derives its
 appointment indirectly from the people the president is indirectly
 derived from the choice of the people according to the example in
 the president of the united states is impeachable at any time
 during his continuance in office the tenure by which the judges
 are to hold their places is as it unquestionably ought to be that
 of good behavior the tenure of the ministerial offices generally
 will be a subject of legal regulation conformably to the reason of
 the objection is founded it will be necessary to a just estimate of
 its force first to ascertain the real character of the government
 in question secondly to inquire how far the convention were
 authorized to propose such a government and thirdly how far the
 duty they owed to their country could supply any defect of regular
 the act therefore establishing the constitution will not be a
 national but a federal act
that it will be a federal and not a national act as these terms
 are understood by the objectors the act of the people as forming
 so many independent states not as forming one aggregate nation is
 act in this relation then the new constitution will if
 established be a federal and not a national constitution
the next relation is to the sources from which the ordinary
 powers of government are to be derived the house of
 representatives will derive its powers from the people of america
 politic from this aspect of the government it appears to be of a
 mixed character presenting at least as many federal as national
 features
the difference between a federal and national government as it
 relates to the operation of the government is supposed to consist
 of its powers it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in
 relation to the extent of its powers the idea of a national
 government involves in it not only an authority over the individual
 citizens but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things
 so far as they are objects of lawful government among a people
 the principle of the case the decision is to be impartially made
 according to the rules of the constitution and all the usual and
 most effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality
 some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the
 sword and a dissolution of the compact and that it ought to be
 proportion by states not by citizens it departs from the national
 and advances towards the federal character in rendering the
 concurrence of less than the whole number of states sufficient it
 loses again the federal and partakes of the national character
the proposed constitution therefore is in strictness neither
the second point to be examined is whether the convention were
authorized to frame and propose this mixed constitution the
powers of the convention ought in strictness to be determined
by an inspection of the commissions given to the members by their
respective constituents as all of these however had reference
hath evinced that there are defects in the present
confederation as a mean to remedy which several of the states
and particularly the state of new york by express instructions
to their delegates in congress have suggested a convention for
the purposes expressed in the following resolution and such
articles of confederation as it is expressed in the act of
congress or by such further provisions as should appear
necessary as it stands in the recommendatory act from annapolis
th that the alterations and provisions were to be reported to
congress and to the states in order to be agreed to by the
possibly in the judgment of the convention be affected by
alterations and provisions in the articles of confederation
which part of the definition ought to have been embraced and
which rejected which was the more important which the less
important part which the end which the means let the most
of the confederation could possibly mould them into a national
and adequate government into such a government as has been
proposed by the convention no stress it is presumed will in
this case be laid on the title a change of that could never be
deemed an exercise of ungranted power alterations in the body of
varied i ask what are these principles do they require that
in the establishment of the constitution the states should be
regarded as distinct and independent sovereigns they are so
regarded by the constitution proposed do they require that the
members of the government should derive their appointment from
operate immediately on the persons and interests of individual
citizens do these fundamental principles require particularly
that no tax should be levied without the intermediate agency of
the states the confederation itself authorizes a direct tax to
a certain extent on the post office the power of coinage has
enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction the
truth is that the great principles of the constitution proposed
by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new than
as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of
confederation the misfortune under the latter system has been
approved and called for by the voice of twelve states comprising
fiftynine sixtieths of the people an example still fresh in the
memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the
wounded honor and prosperity of his country as this objection
therefore has been in a manner waived by those who have
altogether different and will enable us to judge with propriety
of the course taken by the convention let us view the ground on
which the convention stood it may be collected from their
proceedings that they were deeply and unanimously impressed with
the crisis which had led their country almost with one voice to
recommending a great and critical object wholly foreign to their
commission not only justified by the public opinion but
actually carried into effect by twelve out of the thirteen
states they had seen in a variety of instances assumptions by
congress not only of recommendatory but of operative powers
threatened by their ancient government that committees and
congresses were formed for concentrating their efforts and
defending their rights and that conventions were elected in the
several states for establishing the constitutions under which
they are now governed nor could it have been forgotten that no
whose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished and
of pointing out a system capable in their judgment of securing
its happiness taken the cold and sullen resolution of
disappointing its ardent hopes of sacrificing substance to
forms of committing the dearest interests of their country to
circumstances in proposing a constitution for their country does
it follow that the constitution ought for that reason alone to
be rejected if according to the noble precept it be lawful to
accept good advice even from an enemy shall we set the ignoble
example of refusing such advice even when it is offered by our
general view of the powers conferred by the constitution
for the independent journal 
madison
to the people of the state of new york
the constitution proposed by the convention may be considered
inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all
political advantages and on the possible abuses which must be
incident to every power or trust of which a beneficial use can
be made this method of handling the subject cannot impose on the
good sense of the people of america it may display the subtlety
union and that this may be the more conveniently done they may
be reduced into different classes as they relate to the following
different objects  security against foreign danger 
regulation of the intercourse with foreign nations 
maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the states
selfdefense but was it necessary to give an indefinite power
of raising troops as well as providing fleets and of
maintaining both in peace as well as in war the answer to these
questions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit
an extensive discussion of them in this place the answer indeed
unnecessary and multiplied repetitions if one nation maintains
constantly a disciplined army ready for the service of ambition
or revenge it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within
the reach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions
the fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military
and precaution a wise nation will combine all these
considerations and whilst it does not rashly preclude itself
from any resource which may become essential to its safety will
exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the
danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its
never for a moment be forgotten that they are indebted for this
advantage to the union alone the moment of its dissolution will
be the date of a new order of things the fears of the weaker or
the ambition of the stronger states or confederacies will set
the same example in the new as charles vii did in the old
europe this picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be
too highly colored or too often exhibited every man who loves
peace every man who loves his country every man who loves
liberty ought to have it ever before his eyes that he may
cherish in his heart a due attachment to the union of america
american impose on the congress appropriations for two years on
the contrary it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy
themselves that the british constitution fixes no limit whatever
to the discretion of the legislature and that the american ties
down the legislature to two years as the longest admissible
limited to the short period of two years a bad cause seldom
fails to betray itself of this truth the management of the
opposition to the federal government is an unvaried
exemplification but among all the blunders which have been
committed none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on
against a spirit of censure which has spared few other parts it
must indeed be numbered among the greatest blessings of
america that as her union will be the only source of her
maritime strength so this will be a principal source of her
security against danger from abroad in this respect our
frontiers no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety on
this subject than new york her seacoast is extensive a very
important district of the state is an island the state itself is
penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty
leagues the great emporium of its commerce the great reservoir
money being the sinew of that which is to be exerted in the
national defense is properly thrown into the same class with
it this power also has been examined already with much
attention and has i trust been clearly shown to be necessary
both in the extent and form given to it by the constitution i
decrease as the numbers of people increase in a more remote
stage the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw
materials which will be wrought into articles for exportation
and will therefore require rather the encouragement of
bounties than to be loaded with discouraging duties a system of
difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an
authority to legislate in all possible cases a power to destroy
the freedom of the press the trial by jury or even to regulate
the course of descents or the forms of conveyances must be very
singularly expressed by the terms to raise money for the
confound and mislead is an absurdity which as we are reduced
to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection
or on the authors of the constitution we must take the liberty
of supposing had not its origin with the latter the objection
here is the more extraordinary as it appears that the language
and general welfare i appeal to the objectors themselves
whether they would in that case have employed the same reasoning
in justification of congress as they now make use of against the
convention how difficult it is for error to escape its own
condemnation publius 
respect it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations the
powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors
speak their own propriety both of them are comprised in the
articles of confederation with this difference only that the 
former is disembarrassed by the plan of the convention of an
where no such treaties exist the mission of american consuls
into foreign countries may perhaps be covered under the
authority given by the ninth article of the confederation to
appoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing
the general affairs of the united states but the admission of
and is a still greater improvement on the articles of
confederation these articles contain no provision for the case
of offenses against the law of nations and consequently leave
it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the
confederacy with foreign nations the provision of the federal
certainty and uniformity therefore the power of defining
felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper
the regulation of foreign commerce having fallen within several
views which have been taken of this subject has been too fully
discussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly
being redeemed from the oppressions of their european brethren
attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection
against the constitution by representing it on one side as a
criminal toleration of an illicit practice and on another as
calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from
the united states to fix the standard of weights and measures
to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and uniform laws
of bankruptcy to prescribe the manner in which the public acts
records and judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved
and the effect they shall have in other states and to establish
contrivances and both by that and a common knowledge of human
affairs that it would nourish unceasing animosities and not
improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public
tranquillity to those who do not view the question through the
medium of passion or of interest the desire of the commercial
consent of the emperor and the diet though it appears from a
quotation in an antecedent paper that the practice in this as
in many other instances in that confederacy has not followed the
law and has produced there the mischiefs which have been
foreseen here among the restraints imposed by the union of the
endeavored to accomplish impossibilities to reconcile a partial
sovereignty in the union with complete sovereignty in the
states to subvert a mathematical axiom by taking away a part
and letting the whole remain all that need be remarked on the
power to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign
confederation it is declared that the free inhabitants of each
of these states paupers vagabonds and fugitives from justice
excepted shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of
free citizens in the several states and the people of each state
shall in every other enjoy all the privileges of trade and
allow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction but were an
exposition of the term inhabitants to be admitted which
would confine the stipulated privileges to citizens alone the
difficulty is diminished only not removed the very improper
power would still be retained by each state of naturalizing
within the state proscribing them whatever the legal
consequences might have been other consequences would probably
have resulted of too serious a nature not to be provided
against the new constitution has accordingly with great
propriety made provision against them and all others proceeding
particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous states
where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly
translated in any stage of the process within a foreign
jurisdiction the power of establishing post roads must in
every view be a harmless power and may perhaps by judicious
inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors
the public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of
individuals the states cannot separately make effectual
provisions for either of the cases and most of them have
anticipated the decision of this point by laws passed at the
bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence
equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the
other members of the confederacy this consideration has the more
weight as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the
stationary residence of the government would be both too great a
the constitution every imaginable objection seems to be
obviated the necessity of a like authority over forts
magazines etc  established by the general government is not
less evident the public money expended on such places and the
public property deposited in them requires that they should be
conviction of it and restraining the congress even in punishing
it from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of
its author  to admit new states into the union but no new
state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any
other state nor any state be formed by the junction of two or
partition of a state without its consent quiets the jealousy of
the larger states as that of the smaller is quieted by a like
precaution against a junction of states without their consent
 to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory or other property belonging to the
the greater interest have the members in the political
institutions of each other and the greater right to insist that
the forms of government under which the compact was entered into
should be substantially maintained but a right implies a remedy
and where else could the remedy be deposited than where it is
needed the provision for such an event will be a harmless
superfluity only in the constitution but who can say what
experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular states
by the ambition of enterprising leaders or by the intrigues and
influence of foreign powers to the second question it may be
but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more
powerful neighbors the history both of ancient and modern
confederacies proves that the weaker members of the union ought
not to be insensible to the policy of this article protection
against domestic violence is added with equal propriety it has
the authority of the state ought in the latter case to protect
the local magistracy ought not the federal authority in the
former to support the state authority besides there are
certain parts of the state constitutions which are so interwoven
with the federal constitution that a violent blow cannot be
collected exertion of its strength nothing can be more
chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force
victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census
of the inhabitants or which determine the event of an election 
may it not happen in fine that the minority of citizens may
for the universal peace of mankind should it be asked what is
to be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the states
and comprising a superiority of the entire force though not a
constitutional right the answer must be that such a case as
it would be without the compass of human remedies so it is
civil society has the magical effect of dissolving its moral
obligations among the lesser criticisms which have been
exercised on the constitution it has been remarked that the
validity of engagements ought to have been asserted in favor of
the united states as well as against them and in the spirit
was requisite therefore that a mode for introducing them should
be provided the mode preferred by the convention seems to be
stamped with every mark of propriety it guards equally against
that extreme facility which would render the constitution too
mutable and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its
interests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a single
member it would have marked a want of foresight in the
convention which our own experience would have rendered
inexcusable two questions of a very delicate nature present
themselves on this occasion  on what principle the
on the other states should be reduced to the same standard a
compact between independent sovereigns founded on ordinary acts
of legislative authority can pretend to no higher validity than
a league or treaty between the parties it is an established
doctrine on the subject of treaties that all the articles are
that although no political relation can subsist between the
assenting and dissenting states yet the moral relations will
remain uncancelled the claims of justice both on one side and
on the other will be in force and must be fulfilled the
rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually
attainder expostfacto law or law impairing the obligation of
contracts or grant any title of nobility the prohibition
against treaties alliances and confederations makes a part of
the existing articles of union and for reasons which need no
explanation is copied into the new constitution the prohibition
no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify
the forms and weights of the circulating pieces the latter
inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was
originally submitted to the federal head and as far as the
former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and
show the necessity of denying to the states the power of
regulating coin prove with equal force that they ought not to be
at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin had
every state a right to regulate the value of its coin there
might be as many different currencies as states and thus the
fundamental charters our own experience has taught us
nevertheless that additional fences against these dangers ought
not to be omitted very properly therefore have the convention
added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security
and private rights and i am much deceived if they have not in
confederation and needs no comment  no state shall without
the consent of the congress lay any imposts or duties on imports
or exports except what may be absolutely necessary for executing
its inspection laws and the net produce of all duties and
imposts laid by any state on imports or exports shall be for the
which are either so obvious or have been so fully developed
that they may be passed over without remark the sixth and last
class consists of the several powers and provisions by which
efficacy is given to all the rest  of these the first is the
power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
terms necessary and proper they might have attempted a
negative enumeration of them by specifying the powers excepted
from the general definition they might have been altogether
silent on the subject leaving these necessary and proper powers
to construction and inference had the convention taken the
enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their
other powers into effect the attempt would have involved a
complete digest of laws on every subject to which the
constitution relates accommodated too not only to the existing
state of things but to all the possible changes which futurity
that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the
residuum would be less forcibly excepted than if no partial
enumeration had been made had the constitution been silent on
this head there can be no doubt that all the particular powers
requisite as means of executing the general powers would have
legislatures should violate the irrespective constitutional
authorities in the first instance the success of the usurpation
will depend on the executive and judiciary departments which are
to expound and give effect to the legislative acts and in the
last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can by
thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary
notwithstanding the indiscreet zeal of the adversaries to the
constitution has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it
also without which it would have been evidently and radically
defective to be fully sensible of this we need only suppose for
not with other constitutions and would consequently be valid in
some of the states at the same time that it would have no effect
in others in fine the world would have seen for the first
time a system of government founded on an inversion of the
fundamental principles of all government it would have seen the
giving effect to the federal constitution the election of the
president and senate will depend in all cases on the
legislatures of the several states and the election of the house
of representatives will equally depend on the same authority in
the first instance and will probably forever be conducted by
the alleged danger from the powers of the union to the state
governments considered

very fountain if in a word the union be essential to the
happiness of the people of america is it not preposterous to
urge as an objection to a government without which the objects
of the union cannot be attained that such a government may
derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual
attainment of this object were the plan of the convention
adverse to the public happiness my voice would be reject the
plan were the union itself inconsistent with the public
happiness it would be abolish the union in like manner as far
as the sovereignty of the states cannot be reconciled to the
as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the
fate of the former yet as the states will retain under the
proposed constitution a very extensive portion of active
sovereignty the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded in
the achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a
and the people and the sympathy in some instances between the
general sovereign and the latter it usually happened that the
local sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for encroachments
had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and
subordination and particularly had the local sovereigns
determine it the senate will be elected absolutely and
exclusively by the state legislatures even the house of
representatives though drawn immediately from the people will
be chosen very much under the influence of that class of men
whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an
for three millions and more of people intermixed and having
particular acquaintance with every class and circle of people
must exceed beyond all proportion both in number and influence
those of every description who will be employed in the
administration of the federal system compare the members of the

that an option will then be given to the states to supply their
quotas by previous collections of their own and that the
eventual collection under the immediate authority of the union
will generally be made by the officers and according to the
objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce with
which last the power of taxation will for the most part be
connected the powers reserved to the several states will extend
to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs
concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and
peace armies and fleets treaties and finance with the other
more considerable powers are all vested in the existing congress
by the articles of confederation the proposed change does not
enlarge these powers it only substitutes a more effectual mode
of administering them the change relating to taxation may be
federalist no 
the influence of the state and federal governments compared
from the new york packet tuesday january   
madison
to the people of the state of new york
must be told that the ultimate authority wherever the derivative
may be found resides in the people alone and that it will not
depend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the
different governments whether either or which of them will be
able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the
incline experience speaks the same language in this case the
federal administration though hitherto very defective in
comparison with what may be hoped under a better system had
during the war and particularly whilst the independent fund of
paper emissions was in credit an activity and importance as
antecedent propensities and in that case the people ought not
surely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence where
they may discover it to be most due but even in that case the
state governments could have little to apprehend because it is
only within a certain sphere that the federal power can in the
the members of the state governments will carry into the public
councils a bias in favor of the general government a local
spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of
congress than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures
of the particular states every one knows that a great proportion
interests and pursuits of the governments and people of the
individual states what is the spirit that has in general
characterized the proceedings of congress a perusal of their
journals as well as the candid acknowledgments of such as have
had a seat in that assembly will inform us that the members
overruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members were
it admitted however that the federal government may feel an
equal disposition with the state governments to extend its power
beyond the due limits the latter would still have the advantage
in the means of defeating such encroachments if an act of a
state the embarrassments created by legislative devices which
would often be added on such occasions would oppose in any
state difficulties not to be despised would form in a large
state very serious impediments and where the sentiments of
several adjoining states happened to be in unison would present
part the attempt was unjust and unwise but it was not in
speculation absolutely chimerical but what would be the contest
in the case we are supposing who would be the parties a few
representatives of the people would be opposed to the people
themselves or rather one set of representatives would be
every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious
jealousy or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal
than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism
extravagant as the supposition is let it however be made let a
regular army fully equal to the resources of the country be
successful resistance of this country against the british arms
will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it besides the
advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the
people of almost every other nation the existence of
subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by
able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual
possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be
to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors let us
rather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can
ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment
the union and that all those alarms which have been sounded of
a meditated and consequential annihilation of the state
governments must on the most favorable interpretation be
ascribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them publius
federalist no 
a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form
and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the
danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other
parts no political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic
value or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened
cited on this subject is the celebrated montesquieu if he be not
the author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics
he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most
effectually to the attention of mankind let us endeavor in the
first place to ascertain his meaning on this point the british
integral part of the legislative authority he alone has the
prerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns which
when made have under certain limitations the force of
legislative acts all the members of the judiciary department are
appointed by him can be removed by him on the address of the two
own words import and still more conclusively as illustrated by
the example in his eye can amount to no more than this that
where the whole power of one department is exercised by the same
hands which possess the whole power of another department the
fundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted this
judicial power in the last resort the entire legislature again
can exercise no executive prerogative though one of its branches
constitutes the supreme executive magistracy and another on the
impeachment of a third can try and condemn all the subordinate
officers in the executive department the reasons on which
unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down there
is not a single instance in which the several departments of
power have been kept absolutely separate and distinct new
hampshire whose constitution was the last formed seems to have
been fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of
officers of state are also appointed by the legislature and the
members of the judiciary department are appointed by the
executive department the constitution of massachusetts has
observed a sufficient though less pointed caution in expressing
this fundamental article of liberty it declares that the
same authority on the address of the two legislative branches
lastly a number of the officers of government are annually
appointed by the legislative department as the appointment to
offices particularly executive offices is in its nature an
executive function the compilers of the constitution have in
to consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal
members of the judiciary department the constitution of new
jersey has blended the different powers of government more than
any of the preceding the governor who is the executive
magistrate is appointed by the legislature is chancellor and
of the executive counoil are made exofficio justices of peace
throughout the state in delaware the chief executive magistrate
is annually elected by the legislative department the speakers
of the two legislative branches are vicepresidents in the
executive department the executive chief with six others
language of virginia is still more pointed on this subject her
constitution declares that the legislative executive and
judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct so that
neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other nor
shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at
the executive magistracy eligible by the legislative department
it gives to the latter also the appointment of the members of
the judiciary department including even justices of the peace
and sheriffs and the appointment of officers in the executive
department down to captains in the army and navy of the state
violated by too great a mixture and even an actual
consolidation of the different powers and that in no instance
has a competent provision been made for maintaining in practice
the separation delineated on paper what i have wished to evince
is that the charge brought against the proposed constitution of
each a constitutional control over the others the degree of
separation which the maxim requires as essential to a free
government can never in practice be duly maintained it is
agreed on all sides that the powers properly belonging to one of
the departments ought not to be directly and completely
the american constitutions but experience assures us that the
efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated and that
some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the
more feeble against the more powerful members of the
government the legislative department is everywhere extending
for liberty ought to inspire in a democracy where a multitude
of people exercise in person the legislative functions and are
continually exposed by their incapacity for regular deliberation
and concerted measures to the ambitious intrigues of their
executive magistrates tyranny may well be apprehended on some
makes on the coordinate departments it is not unfrequently a
question of real nicety in legislative bodies whether the
operation of a particular measure will or will not extend
beyond the legislative sphere on the other side the executive
power being restrained within a narrower compass and being more
concise and at the same time equally satisfactory evidence i
will refer to the example of two states attested by two
unexceptionable authorities the first example is that of
virginia a state which as we have seen has expressly declared
in its constitution that the three great departments ought not
founded on free principles but in which the powers of government
should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of
magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits
without being effectually checked and restrained by the others
for this reason that convention which passed the ordinance of
an example is pennsylvania and the other authority the council
of censors which assembled in the years  and  a part of
the duty of this body as marked out by the constitution was
to inquire whether the constitution had been preserved
inviolate in every part and whether the legislative and
assumed which had not been delegated by the constitution
executive powers had been usurped the salaries of the judges
which the constitution expressly requires to be fixed had been
occasionally varied and cases belonging to the judiciary
department frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and
members composing it in this respect it has as much affinity
to a legislative assembly as to an executive council and being
at once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility
for the acts of the body and deriving confidence from mutual
example and joint influence unauthorized measures would of
the last paper has subjoined to that valuable work the draught
of a constitution which had been prepared in order to be laid
before a convention expected to be called in  by the
legislature for the establishment of a constitution for that
commonwealth the plan like every thing from the same pen marks
government hold their power is derived it seems strictly
consonant to the republican theory to recur to the same original
authority not only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge
diminish or newmodel the powers of the government but also
whenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on
reach the case of a combination of two of the departments against
the third if the legislative authority which possesses so many
means of operating on the motives of the other departments
should be able to gain to its interest either of the others or
even one third of its members the remaining department could
number with which it is associated when the examples which
fortify opinion are ancient as well as numerous they are known
to have a double effect in a nation of philosophers this
consideration ought to be disregarded a reverence for the laws
would be sufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened
leaders which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on
great national questions of a universal ardor for new and
opposite forms produced by a universal resentment and
indignation against the ancient government and whilst no spirit
of party connected with the changes to be made or the abuses to
too far removed from the people to share much in their
prepossessions the former are generally the objects of jealousy
and their administration is always liable to be discolored and
rendered unpopular the members of the legislative department on
the other hand are numberous they are distributed and dwell
actually were or who expected to be members of the department
whose conduct was arraigned they would consequently be parties
to the very question to be decided by them it might however
sometimes happen that appeals would be made under circumstances
less adverse to the executive and judiciary departments the
passions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government
we found in the last paper that mere declarations in the written
constitution are not sufficient to restrain the several
departments within their legal rights it appears in this that
occasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an
constitution by keeping the several departments of power within
their due bounds without particularly considering them as
provisions for altering the constitution itself in the first
view appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be nearly

different states to one uniform rule would probably have been as

principal objects of federal legislation and suggest most

which are not unworthy of notice the distance which many of the
representatives will be obliged to travel and the arrangements
rendered necessary by that circumstance might be much more

to the people of the state of new york
states it is evidently the least objectionable among the
practicable rules and had too recently obtained the general
sanction of america not to have found a ready preference with
the convention all this is admitted it will perhaps be said
but does it follow from an admission of numbers for the measure
laws in some respects as persons and in other respects as
property in being compelled to labor not for himself but for
a master in being vendible by one master to another master and
in being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty and
chastised in his body by the capricious will of another the
that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers and
it is admitted that if the laws were to restore the rights which
have been taken away the negroes could no longer be refused an
equal share of representation with the other inhabitants this
question may be placed in another light it is agreed on all
they complain it may be replied perhaps that slaves are not
included in the estimate of representatives in any of the states
possessing them they neither vote themselves nor increase the
votes of their masters upon what principle then ought they to
be taken into the federal estimate of representation in
complaint by insisting that the principle laid down by the
convention required that no regard should be had to the policy of
particular states towards their own inhabitants and
consequently that the slaves as inhabitants should have been
admitted into the census according to their full number in like
other therefore may be considered as represented by those who
are charged with the government upon this principle it is that
in several of the states and particularly in the state of new
york one branch of the government is intended more especially to
be the guardian of property and is accordingly elected by that
that the richest state in the confederacy will ever influence the
choice of a single representative in any other state nor will
the representatives of the larger and richer states possess any
other advantage in the federal legislature over the
representatives of other states than what may result from their
smaller state or a state more or less wealthy or powerful will
have an equal weight and efficacy in the same manner as the
votes individually given in a state legislature by the
representatives of unequal counties or other districts have
each a precise equality of value and effect or if there be any
an interest in exaggerating their inhabitants were the rule to
decide their share of taxation alone a contrary temptation would
prevail by extending the rule to both objects the states will
have opposite interests which will control and balance each
other and produce the requisite impartiality publius 
citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the
mass of the people and be most likely to aim at a permanent
elevation of the few on the depression of the many fourthly
that defective as the number will be in the first instance it
will be more and more disproportionate by the increase of the
to that of south carolina as six to five has little more than
one third of the number of representatives as great a disparity
prevails between the states of georgia and delaware or rhode
island in pennsylvania the representatives do not bear a
greater proportion to their constituents than of one for every
power than six or seven but it does not follow that six or seven
hundred would be proportionably a better depositary and if we
carry on the supposition to six or seven thousand the whole
reasoning ought to be reversed the truth is that in all cases a
certain number at least seems to be necessary to secure the
legislative bodies with these general ideas in our mind let us
weigh the objections which have been stated against the number of
members proposed for the house of representatives it is said in
the first place that so small a number cannot be safely trusted
with so much power the number of which this branch of the
body i take for granted here what i shall in answering the
fourth objection hereafter show that the number of
representatives will be augmented from time to time in the
manner provided by the constitution on a contrary supposition i
should admit the objection to have very great weight indeed the
which must feel so many motives to watch and which possess so
many means of counteracting the federal legislature would fail
either to detect or to defeat a conspiracy of the latter against
the liberties of their common constituents i am equally unable
to conceive that there are at this time or can be in any short
body than their successors will be they were not chosen by nor
responsible to their fellowcitizens at large though appointed
from year to year and recallable at pleasure they were
generally continued for three years and prior to the
ratification of the federal articles for a still longer term
different purposes their private fortunes as they must allbe
american citizens cannot possibly be sources of danger the
only means then which they can possess will be in the
dispensation of appointments is it here that suspicion rests
her charge sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption
indiscriminate and unbounded jealousy with which all reasoning
must be vain the sincere friends of liberty who give
themselves up to the extravagancies of this passion are not
aware of the injury they do their own cause as there is a
degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of
the second charge against the house of representatives is that
it will be too small to possess a due knowledge of the interests
of its constituents as this objection evidently proceeds from a
comparison of the proposed number of representatives with the
great extent of the united states the number of their
importance and which seem most to require local knowledge are
commerce taxation and the militia a proper regulation of
commerce requires much information as has been elsewhere
remarked but as far as this information relates to the laws and
local situation of each individual state a very few
by the federal legislature than to review the different laws
and reduce them in one general act a skillful individual in his
closet with all the local codes before him might compile a law
on some subjects of taxation for the whole union without any aid
from oral information and it may be expected that whenever
the very time be members of the state legislature where all the
local information and interests of the state are assembled and
from whence they may easily be conveyed by a very few hands into
the legislature of the united states the observations made on
the subject of taxation apply with greater force to the case of
individual state perfectly simple and uniform a knowledge of
them in one part would involve a knowledge of them in every
other and the whole state might be competently represented by a
single member taken from any part of it on a comparison of the
different states together we find a great dissimilarity in their
taken care that the progress of population may be accompanied
with a proper increase of the representative branch of the
government the experience of great britain which presents to
mankind so many political lessons both of the monitory and
exemplary kind and which has been frequently consulted in the
than a mere deduction from the real representatives of the
nation we will however consider them in this light alone and
will not extend the deduction to a considerable number of

effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they
continue to hold their public trust the elective mode of
obtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican

branch of the legislature of the state who are to be the objects
of popular choice every citizen whose merit may recommend him to

wealth of birth of religious faith or of civil profession is
permitted to fetter the judgement or disappoint the inclination
nature and it must be confessed that instances of it are but too
frequent and flagrant both in public and in private life but
the universal and extreme indignation which it inspires is itself
a proof of the energy and prevalence of the contrary sentiment
in the third place those ties which bind the representative to
is to cease when their exercise of it is to be reviewed and
when they must descend to the level from which they were raised
there forever to remain unless a faithful discharge of their
trust shall have established their title to a renewal of it i
will add as a fifth circumstance in the situation of the house
as well as on the people the people will be prepared to tolerate
any thing but liberty such will be the relation between the
house of representatives and their constituents duty gratitude
interest ambition itself are the chords by which they will be
bound to fidelity and sympathy with the great mass of the people
representatives he could suppose nothing less than that some
unreasonable qualification of property was annexed to the right
of suffrage or that the right of eligibility was limited to
persons of particular families or fortunes or at least that the
mode prescribed by the state constitutions was in some respect or
likely to be found so the choice would be less likely to be
diverted from him by the intrigues of the ambitious or the
ambitious or the bribes of the rich is the consequence from
this doctrine admissible if we say that five or six hundred
citizens are as many as can jointly exercise their right of
annual value of more than twenty pounds sterling according to
the present rate of money notwithstanding these unfavorable
circumstances and notwithstanding some very unequal laws in the
british code it cannot be said that the representatives of the
nation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many but we
representatives are almost as large as her districts will be by
which her federal representatives will be elected the city of
philadelphia is supposed to contain between fifty and sixty
thousand souls it will therefore form nearly two districts for
the choice of federal representatives it forms however but
that each member of it is elected by the whole state so is the
governor of that state of massachusetts and of this state and
the president of new hampshire i leave every man to decide
whether the result of any one of these experiments can be said to
countenance a suspicion that a diffusive mode of choosing
seem not to have recollected that the federal constitution will
not suffer by a comparison with the state constitutions in the
security provided for a gradual augmentation of the number of
representatives the number which is to prevail in the first
instance is declared to be temporary its duration is limited to
constituents and it appears that the former have been as ready
to concur in such measures as the latter have been to call for
them  there is a peculiarity in the federal constitution which
insures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and
of their representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the
equity and the principles of the constitution it may be
alleged perhaps that the senate would be prompted by like
motives to an adverse coalition and as their concurrence would
be indispensable the just and constitutional views of the other
branch might be defeated this is the difficulty which has
force of all these solemn considerations it is farther to be
considered that in the gradation between the smallest and
largest states there are several which though most likely in
general to arrange themselves among the former are too little
removed in extent and population from the latter to second an
ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been
indulged with regard to it admitting however that they should
all be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller
states or their predominant influence in the councils of the
senate a constitutional and infallible resource still remains
will they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or
its reputation on the pliancy of the senate or if such a trial
of firmness between the two branches were hazarded would not the
one be as likely first to yield as the other these questions
will create no difficulty with those who reflect that in all
review of the constitution of the house of representatives i
have passed over the circumstances of economy which in the
present state of affairs might have had some effect in lessening
the temporary number of representatives and a disregard of which
would probably have been as rich a theme of declamation against
where the whole body of the people assembled in person a single
orator or an artful statesman was generally seen to rule with
as complete a sway as if a sceptre had been placed in his single
hand on the same principle the more multitudinous a
representative assembly may be rendered the more it will partake
legislative business it has been said that more than a majority
ought to have been required for a quorum and in particular
cases if not in all more than a majority of a quorum for a

mistaken notwithstanding if there be any article in the whole
plan more completely defensible than this its propriety rests
upon the evidence of this plain proposition that every
government ought to contain in itself the means of its own
power could have been reasonably modified and disposed that it
must either have been lodged wholly in the national legislature
or wholly in the state legislatures or primarily in the latter
and ultimately in the former the last mode has with reason
been preferred by the convention they have submitted the
risk the extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can
never be dignified with that character if we are in a humor to
presume abuses of power it is as fair to presume them on the
part of the state governments as on the part of the general
government and as it is more consonant to the rules of a just
to depend on itself for its own preservation as an objection to
this position it may be remarked that the constitution of the
national senate would involve in its full extent the danger
which it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the
state legislatures to regulate the federal elections it may be
the formation of the senate to recommend their admission into
the system so far as that construction may expose the union to
the possibility of injury from the state legislatures it is an
evil but it is an evil which could not have been avoided without
excluding the states in their political capacities wholly from
years and no state is to be entitled to more than two senators
a quorum of the body is to consist of sixteen members the joint
result of these circumstances would be that a temporary
combination of a few states to intermit the appointment of
senators could neither annul the existence nor impair the
to prevent an election i shall not deny that there is a degree
of weight in the observation that the interests of each state
to be represented in the federal councils will be a security
against the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of
the state legislatures but the security will not be considered
public weal with so effectual a weapon in their hands as the
exclusive power of regulating elections for the national

 powerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of

 parts of the union to occasion a material diversity of disposition
 national government in respect to that body can affect the spirit
 which will direct the choice of its members the collective sense
 of the state legislatures can never be influenced by extraneous
 circumstances of that sort a consideration which alone ought to
 satisfy us that the discrimination apprehended would never be
 moneyed interest or the mercantile interest or the manufacturing
 interest or to speak in the fashionable language of the
 adversaries to the constitution will it court the elevation of
 the wealthy and the wellborn to the exclusion and debasement
 of all the rest of the society
 this will be an emanation from a greater variety of interests and
 in much more various proportions than are to be found in any single
 state it will be much less apt to espouse either of them with a
 decided partiality than the representation of any single state
in a country consisting chiefly of the cultivators of land
 quarter as from the other
in order perhaps to give countenance to the objection at any
 rate it may be asked is there not danger of an opposite bias in
 the national government which may dispose it to endeavor to secure
 a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class as
 enmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor
 by the urgent calls of public necessity
i the rather consult brevity in discussing the probability of a
 preference founded upon a discrimination between the different kinds
 of industry and property because as far as i understand the
 the towns or cities or are they on the contrary scattered over
 the face of the country as avarice or chance may have happened to
 cast their own lot or that of their predecessors if the latter is
 the case as every intelligent man knows it to be is it not
 evident that the policy of confining the places of election to
 still i imagine it will hardly be pretended that they could ever
 hope to carry such an enterprise into execution without the aid of a
 military force sufficient to subdue the resistance of the great body
 of the people the improbability of the existence of a force equal

 had the effect of quieting apprehensions it might not have been
 undesirable but it would in fact have afforded little or no
 additional security against the danger apprehended and the want of

 constitution of new york makes no other provision for locality of
 elections than that the members of the assembly shall be elected in
 the counties those of the senate in the great districts into
 which the state is or may be divided these at present are four in
 number and comprehend each from two to six counties it may
 the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws
 which afford every facility to it furnishes a ready answer to this
 question and abstracted from any experience on the subject we
 can be at no loss to determine that when the place of election is
 at an inconvenient distance from the elector the effect upon his
 disposed to consider as innocent omissions in the state
 constitutions what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the
 plan of the convention nothing can be said or at most they can
 only be asked to assign some substantial reason why the
 representatives of the people in a single state should be more
 of the danger of placing the power elsewhere and on that of the
 safety of placing it in the manner proposed but there remains to
 be mentioned a positive advantage which will result from this
 disposition and which could not as well have been obtained from any
 other i allude to the circumstance of uniformity in the time of
 sufficient force of mind to resist i am inclined to think that
 treble the duration in office with the condition of a total
 dissolution of the body at the same time might be less formidable
 to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and
 successive alterations
 would have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish
 as a fundamental point what would deprive several states of the
 convenience of having the elections for their own governments and
 for the national government at the same epochs

 from those of representatives consist in a more advanced age and a
 longer period of citizenship a senator must be thirty years of age
 at least as a representative must be twentyfive and the former
 must have been a citizen nine years as seven years are required
 for the latter the propriety of these distinctions is explained by
 probably the most congenial with the public opinion it is
 recommended by the double advantage of favoring a select
 appointment and of giving to the state governments such an agency
 in the formation of the federal government as must secure the
 authority of the former and may form a convenient link between the
 concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered
 indispensable a common government with powers equal to its
 objects is called for by the voice and still more loudly by the
 political situation of america a government founded on principles
 more consonant to the wishes of the larger states is not likely to
 constitution of the senate is the additional impediment it must
 prove against improper acts of legislation no law or resolution
 can now be passed without the concurrence first of a majority of
 the people and then of a majority of the states it must be
 acknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some
 inconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an
 institution
first it is a misfortune incident to republican
 government though in a less degree than to other governments that
 those who administer it may forget their obligations to their
 by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to
 the impulse of sudden and violent passions and to be seduced by
 factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions
 examples on this subject might be cited without number and from
 proceedings within the united states as well as from the history of
 embarrassments of america is to be charged on the blunders of our
 governments and that these have proceeded from the heads rather
 than the hearts of most of the authors of them what indeed are all
 the repealing explaining and amending laws which fill and
 disgrace our voluminous codes but so many monuments of deficient
 stable institution in the government every new election in the
 states is found to change one half of the representatives from
 this change of men must proceed a change of opinions and from a
 change of opinions a change of measures but a continual change
 even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence
 fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter are under fewer
 restraints also from taking undue advantage from the indiscretions
 of each other every nation consequently whose affairs betray a
 want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can
 be sustained from the more systematic policy of their wiser
another effect of public instability is the unreasonable
 advantage it gives to the sagacious the enterprising and the
 moneyed few over the industrious and uniformed mass of the people
 every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue or in any way
 affecting the value of the different species of property presents a
 forward which requires the auspices of a steady system of national
 policy
but the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of
 attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people
 towards a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity
 world which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit than
 it is to obtain its respect and confidence
an attention to the judgment of other nations is important to
 every government for two reasons the one is that independently
 of the merits of any particular plan or measure it is desirable on
 members may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and
 prosperity of the community the halfyearly representatives of
 rhode island would probably have been little affected in their
 deliberations on the iniquitous measures of that state by arguments
 drawn from the light in which such measures would be viewed by
 one depending on measures which have singly an immediate and
 sensible operation the other depending on a succession of
 wellchosen and wellconnected measures which have a gradual and
 perhaps unobserved operation the importance of the latter
 description to the collective and permanent welfare of every
 train of measures may be justly and effectually answerable for the
 attainment of those objects
thus far i have considered the circumstances which point out the
 necessity of a wellconstructed senate only as they relate to the
 representatives of the people to a people as little blinded by
 escaped if their government had contained so provident a safeguard
 against the tyranny of their own passions popular liberty might
 then have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same
 citizens the hemlock on one day and statues on the next
it may be suggested that a people spread over an extensive
 states to whom that character can be applied in each of the two
 first there was a senate for life the constitution of the senate
 in the last is less known circumstantial evidence makes it
 probable that it was not different in this particular from the two
 others it is at least certain that it had some quality or other
 the people and to the people themselves there are others peculiar
 to the former which require the control of such an institution
 the people can never wilfully betray their own interests but they
 may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people and
 the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative
in the most pure democracies of greece many of the executive
 functions were performed not by the people themselves but by
 officers elected by the people and representing the people in their
 executive capacity
prior to the reform of solon athens was governed by nine
 capacity the cosmi of crete were also annually elected by the
 people and have been considered by some authors as an institution
 analogous to those of sparta and rome with this difference only
 that in the election of that representative body the right of
 suffrage was communicated to a part only of the people
 jealous adversary of the constitution will probably content himself
 with repeating that a senate appointed not immediately by the
 people and for the term of six years must gradually acquire a
 dangerous preeminence in the government and finally transform it
 into a tyrannical aristocracy
 on the house of representatives the opposition of that coequal
 branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt and
 without corrupting the people themselves a succession of new
 representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine
 order is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the
 betrayed by the senate of maryland but no such symptoms have
 appeared on the contrary the jealousies at first entertained by
 men of the same description with those who view with terror the
 correspondent part of the federal constitution have been gradually
 extinguished by the progress of the experiment and the maryland
 representatives and that it no sooner lost the support of the
 monarch than it was actually crushed by the weight of the popular
 branch
as far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject its
 examples support the reasoning which we have employed in sparta
 itself by gradual usurpations into an independent and aristocratic
 body we are warranted in believing that if such a revolution
 should ever happen from causes which the foresight of man cannot
 guard against the house of representatives with the people on
 their side will at all times be able to bring back the constitution
 of blame unless on this principle it is difficult to explain the

as the select assemblies for choosing the president as well as
 the state legislatures who appoint the senators will in general be
 composed of the most enlightened and respectable citizens there is
 reason to presume that their attention and their votes will be
 so chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand
 our national interests whether considered in relation to the
 several states or to foreign nations who are best able to promote
 those interests and whose reputation for integrity inspires and
 merits confidence with such men the power of making treaties may

 them an opportunity of greatly extending their political

 more beneficial to their country nor has the convention discovered

 intelligence may be obtained if the persons possessing it can be
 relieved from apprehensions of discovery those apprehensions will

 friendly motives and there doubtless are many of both

some are displeased with it not on account of any errors or
 defects in it but because as the treaties when made are to have
 the force of laws they should be made only by men invested with
 legislative authority these gentlemen seem not to consider that
 the judgments of our courts and the commissions constitutionally
 assembly should be repealable at pleasure this idea seems to be
 new and peculiar to this country but new errors as well as new
 truths often appear these gentlemen would do well to reflect that
 a treaty is only another name for a bargain and that it would be
 impossible to find a nation who would make any bargain with us
 probably proceed the fears and apprehensions of some that the
 president and senate may make treaties without an equal eye to the
 interests of all the states others suspect that two thirds will
 oppress the remaining third and ask whether those gentlemen are
 made sufficiently responsible for their conduct whether if they
 from that of the nation they will be under no temptations to
 neglect the latter

 denominated political as they relate chiefly to injuries done
 immediately to the society itself the prosecution of them for
 this reason will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole
 community and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or

 depositary of this important trust those who can best discern the
 intrinsic difficulty of the thing will be least hasty in condemning
 that opinion and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the
 arguments which may be supposed to have produced it
 of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the
 government is not this the true light in which it ought to be
 regarded
where else than in the senate could have been found a tribunal
 sufficiently dignified or sufficiently independent what other
 would consist with a reasonable attention to economy the necessity
 of a numerous court for the trial of impeachments is equally
 dictated by the nature of the proceeding this can never be tied
 down by such strict rules either in the delineation of the offense
 by the prosecutors or in the construction of it by the judges as
 emoluments of his country he will still be liable to prosecution
 and punishment in the ordinary course of law would it be proper
 that the persons who had disposed of his fame and his most valuable
 rights as a citizen in one trial should in another trial for the
 same offense be also the disposers of his life and his fortune
 refer the main question to the decision of the court who would be
 willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury
 acting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt
would it have been an improvement of the plan to have united
 the supreme court with the senate in the formation of the court of
 against as in favor of such a plan to some minds it will not
 appear a trivial objection that it could tend to increase the
 complexity of the political machine and to add a new spring to the
 government the utility of which would at best be questionable but
 an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention
 which delay would afford to intrigue and corruption and in some
 cases the detriment to the state from the prolonged inaction of men
 whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed
 them to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in
 the house of representatives though this latter supposition may
 ought to prove not merely that particular provisions in it are not
 the best which might have been imagined but that the plan upon the
 whole is bad and pernicious

 intermixture of those departments for special purposes preserving
 them in the main distinct and unconnected this partial
 intermixture is even in some cases not only proper but necessary
 to the mutual defense of the several members of the government
 against each other an absolute or qualified negative in the
 profess to admire without exception the constitution of this
 state while that constitution makes the senate together with the
 chancellor and judges of the supreme court not only a court of
 impeachments but the highest judicatory in the state in all
 causes civil and criminal the proportion in point of numbers of
 precise answer where is the measure or criterion to which we can
 appeal for determining what will give the senate too much too
 little or barely the proper degree of influence will it not be
 more safe as well as more simple to dismiss such vague and
 uncertain calculations to examine each power by itself and to
 the senate ought to be discarded from our reasonings
but this hypothesis such as it is has already been refuted in
 the remarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the
 senators it was by them shown as well on the credit of historical
 examples as from the reason of the thing that the most popular
 influence to that body the more it is contemplated the more
 important will appear this ultimate though contingent power of
 deciding the competitions of the most illustrious citizens of the
 union for the first office in it it would not perhaps be rash to
 predict that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh
 administration of affairs will inspire a sufficient disposition to
 dismiss from a share in it all such who by their conduct shall
 have proved themselves unworthy of the confidence reposed in them
 though facts may not always correspond with this presumption yet
 if it be in the main just it must destroy the supposition that
 ground of opposition to him and they could not be sure if they
 withheld their assent that the subsequent nomination would fall
 upon their own favorite or upon any other person in their
 estimation more meritorious than the one rejected thus it could
 hardly happen that the majority of the senate would feel any other
 rest upon an erroneous foundation
the security essentially intended by the constitution against
 corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties is to be
 sought for in the numbers and characters of those who are to make
 them the joint agency of the chief magistrate of the union and of
 representatives impeach themselves not better it is evident than
 two thirds of the senate might try themselves and yet what reason
 is there that a majority of the house of representatives
 sacrificing the interests of the society by an unjust and tyrannical
 act of legislation should escape with impunity more than two
 leading members by whose arts and influence the majority may have
 been inveigled into measures odious to the community if the proofs
 of that corruption should be satisfactory the usual propensity of
 human nature will warrant us in concluding that there would be
 commonly no defect of inclination in the body to divert the public
 atten ed with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this
 and there is perhaps none which has been inveighed against with
 less candor or criticised with less judgment
here the writers against the constitution seem to have taken
 pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation calculating
 taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering janizaries
 and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio
attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or it might
 rather be said to metamorphose the object render it necessary to
 take an accurate view of its real nature and form in order as well
 of the president of the united states it is still more impossible
 to withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients
 which have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition
in one instance which i cite as a sample of the general spirit
 the temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the president of
 appointments are not in the constitution otherwise provided for and
 which shall be established by law immediately after this clause
 follows another in these words the president shall have power to
 fill up  vacancies that may happen during the recess of the
 senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of
 which that clause stands to the other which declares the general
 mode of appointing officers of the united states denotes it to be
 nothing more than a supplement to the other for the purpose of
 establishing an auxiliary method of appointment in cases to which
 the general method was inadequate the ordinary power of
 that body conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision which
 if it had been intended to comprehend senators would naturally have
 referred the temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of
 the state legislatures who are to make the permanent appointments
 and not to the recess of the national senate who are to have no
 of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature thereof
 for six years and the latter directs that if vacancies in
 that body should happen by resignation or otherwise during the
 recess of the legislature of any state the executive thereof may
 make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the
 animadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these
 papers i hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid
 and honest adversary of the proposed government whether language
 can furnish epithets of too much asperity for so shameless and so
 prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of america
 affirm that if the manner of it be not perfect it is at least
 excellent it unites in an eminent degree all the advantages the
 union of which was to be wished for
it was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in
 the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be
 so happily concerted in the system under consideration promise an
 effectual security against this mischief the choice of several to
 form an intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to
 convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements
 than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the
 beforehand to prostitute their votes but they have referred it in
 the first instance to an immediate act of the people of america to
 be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and sole
 purpose of making the appointment and they have excluded from
 eligibility to this trust all those who from situation might be
 but the people themselves he might otherwise be tempted to
 sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was
 necessary to the duration of his official consequence this
 advantage will also be secured by making his reelection to depend
 on a special body of representatives deputed by the society for the
 office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not
 in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications
 talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity may
 alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single
 state but it will require other talents and a different kind of
 president with this difference that the senate is to do in
 respect to the former what is to be done by the house of
 representatives in respect to the latter
the appointment of an extraordinary person as vicepresident
 has been objected to as superfluous if not mischievous it has

 particular there be a resemblance to the king of great britain
 there is not less a resemblance to the grand seignior to the khan
 of tartary to the man of the seven mountains or to the governor of
 new york
that magistrate is to be elected for four years and is to be
 afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary
 course of law the person of the king of great britain is sacred
 and inviolable there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is
 amenable no punishment to which he can be subjected without
 involving the crisis of a national revolution in this delicate and
 agitation the qualified negative of the president differs widely
 from this absolute negative of the british sovereign and tallies
 exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of
 this state of which the governor is a constituent part in this
 respect the power of the president would exceed that of the governor
 united states in most of these particulars the power of the
 president will resemble equally that of the king of great britain
 and of the governor of new york the most material points of
 difference are these  first the president will have only the
 occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by
 militia and navy but the constitutions of several of the states
 expressly declare their governors to be commandersinchief as well
 of the army as navy and it may well be a question whether those
 of new hampshire and massachusetts in particular do not in this
 instance confer larger powers upon their respective governors than
 the prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a
 greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise
 against the public liberty than the mere prospect of an exemption
 from death and confiscation if the final execution of the design
 upon an actual appeal to arms should miscarry would this last

 every other description it has been insinuated that his authority

 treaty and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new
 state of things to keep the machine from running into disorder in
 this respect therefore there is no comparison between the intended
 power of the president and the actual power of the british sovereign 
 take the place of a departed predecessor
the president is to nominate and with the advice and consent
 of the senate to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers
 judges of the supreme court and in general all officers of the
 united states established by law and whose appointments are not
 senate should be divided no appointment could be made in the
 government of new york if the council should be divided the
 governor can turn the scale and confirm his own nomination
 if we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode
 of appointment by the president and an entire branch of the national
 may be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude
 into a closer group
the president of the united states would be an officer elected
 by the people for four years the king of great britain is a
 perpetual and hereditary prince the one would be amenable to
 establish markets and fairs can regulate weights and measures can
 lay embargoes for a limited time can coin money can authorize or

 government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of
 foundation since they can never admit its truth without at the

 energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of
 government a feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad
 execution and a government ill executed whatever it may be in
 theory must be in practice a bad government

 securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated

 efficacy as well on account of the division of the censure
 attendant on bad measures among a number as on account of the
 the counsel given to him at his sole discretion
but in a republic where every magistrate ought to be personally
 responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the
 british constitution dictates the propriety of a council not only
 ceases to apply but turns against the institution in the monarchy
 executive power is more easily confined when it is one that
 it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy
 and watchfulness of the people and in a word that all
 multiplication of the executive is rather dangerous than friendly to
 liberty
 would think of proposing an executive much more numerous than that
 body from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the
 council the extreme of these numbers is not too great for an easy
 combination and from such a combination america would have more to
 fear than from the ambition of any single individual a council to

 trust than to any article of ordinary property the inference from
 it is that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate under
 a consciousness that in a very short time he must lay down his
 office will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to
 hazard any material censure or perplexity from the independent
 of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs but
 it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden
 breeze of passion or to every transient impulse which the people
 may receive from the arts of men who flatter their prejudices to
 betray their interests it is a just observation that the people
 has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had
 courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their
 displeasure

 complaisance in the executive to the inclinations of the people we

nor is this all the superior weight and influence of the
 kingdom will accede to the justness of this remark a very
 considerable period has elapsed since the negative of the crown has
 been exercised
if a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a british
 monarch would have scruples about the exercise of the power under
 supposition his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate
 interest in the power of his office in the latter by the
 probability of the sanction of his constituents who though they
 would naturally incline to the legislative body in a doubtful case
 would hardly suffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain
 it would embark in it a very respectable proportion of the
 legislative body whose influence would be united with his in
 supporting the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion a
 direct and categorical negative has something in the appearance of
 it more harsh and more apt to irritate than the mere suggestion of
 feared
this qualified negative as has been elsewhere remarked is in

 chancellor and judges of the supreme court or any two of them it

 consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the

 light i shall here content myself with offering only some
 supplementary remarks principally with a view to the objections
 which have been just stated
with regard to the intermixture of powers i shall rely upon the
 all the functions of the executive magistrate the power of making
 treaties is plainly neither the one nor the other it relates
 neither to the execution of the subsisting laws nor to the enaction
 of new ones and still less to an exertion of the common strength
 its objects are contracts with foreign nations which have the
 the remark is unquestionably just that an hereditary monarch
 though often the oppressor of his people has personally too much
 stake in the government to be in any material danger of being
 corrupted by foreign powers but a man raised from the station of a
 private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate possessed of a
 constitutional agency of the president in the conduct of foreign
 negotiations it is true that the senate would in that case have
 the option of employing him in this capacity but they would also
 have the option of letting it alone and pique or cabal might induce
 the latter rather than the former besides this the ministerial
 be filled by men of such characters as to render their concurrence
 in the formation of treaties peculiarly desirable as well on the
 score of wisdom as on that of integrity
the remarks made in a former number which have been alluded to
 in another part of this paper will apply with conclusive force
 condemn the project
the only objection which remains to be canvassed is that which
 would substitute the proportion of two thirds of all the members
 composing the senatorial body to that of two thirds of the members
 present it has been shown under the second head of our inquiries
 foreign precedents unnecessary
to require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not in
 all probability contribute to the advantages of a numerous agency
 better then merely to require a proportion of the attending members
 the former by making a determinate number at all times requisite
 number of the active voices in the existing congress when in
 addition to these considerations we take into view the cooperation
 of the president we shall not hesitate to infer that the people of
 america would have greater security against an improper use of the
 power of making treaties under the new constitution than they now
 consent of the senate to appoint ambassadors other public
 ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other
 officers of the united states whose appointments are not otherwise
 provided for in the constitution but the congress may by law vest

 ought either to be vested in a single man or in a select assembly
 of a moderate number or in a single man with the concurrence of
 such an assembly the exercise of it by the people at large will be
 readily admitted to be impracticable as waiving every other
 a body of men of equal or perhaps even of superior discernment
the sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally
 beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation 
 he will on this account feel himself under stronger obligations
 and more interested to investigate with care the qualities requisite
 time happen to be made under such circumstances will of course be
 the result either of a victory gained by one party over the other
 or of a compromise between the parties in either case the
 intrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight in
 the first the qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages
 that officer would be avoided in the act of nomination his
 judgment alone would be exercised and as it would be his sole duty
 to point out the man who with the approbation of the senate should
 fill an office his responsibility would be as complete as if he
 were to make the final appointment there can in this view be no
 advancement of the public service will be the primary object either
 of party victories or of party negotiations
the truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been
 felt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault with the
 provision made in this respect by the convention they contend
but might not his nomination be overruled i grant it might
 yet this could only be to make place for another nomination by
 himself the person ultimately appointed must be the object of his
 preference though perhaps not in the first degree it is also not
 very probable that his nomination would often be overruled the
 from state prejudice from family connection from personal
 attachment or from a view to popularity in addition to this it
 would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration
it will readily be comprehended that a man who had himself the
 sole disposition of offices would be governed much more by his
to this reasoning it has been objected that the president by
 the influence of the power of nomination may secure the
 complaisance of the senate to his views this supposition of
 universal venalty in human nature is little less an error in
 political reasoning than the supposition of universal rectitude
 supposition that he could in general purchase the integrity of the
 whole body would be forced and improbable a man disposed to view
 human nature as it is without either flattering its virtues or
 exaggerating its vices will see sufficient ground of confidence in
 the probity of the senate to rest satisfied not only that it will

to this union of the senate with the president in the article

 serve to give the president an undue influence over the senate and

 employing their right of negative upon his nominations if it be
 said they might sometimes gratify him by an acquiescence in a
 favorite choice when public motives might dictate a different

 necessity for submitting each nomination to the judgment of an
 entire branch of the legislature the circumstances attending an
 appointment from the mode of conducting it would naturally become
 matters of notoriety and the public would be at no loss to
 determine what part had been performed by the different actors the
 bad appointment on account of the uncertainty of its author and
 for want of a determinate object has neither poignancy nor duration 
 and while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open all
 idea of responsibility is lost the most that the public can know
 is that the governor claims the right of nomination that two out
every mere council of appointment however constituted will be
 a conclave in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope
 their number without an unwarrantable increase of expense cannot
 be large enough to preclude a facility of combination and as each
 member will have his friends and connections to provide for the
 stability in the administration of the government and a diminution
 of the security against an undue influence of the executive and
 yet such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential
 amendment in the proposed constitution

 dependence on the people a due responsibility the answer to this
the judiciary department
from mcleans edition new york
hamilton
to the people of the state of new york
we proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of
 general and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers
 that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition
second as to the tenure by which the judges are to hold
 their places this chiefly concerns their duration in office the
 provisions for their support the precautions for their
whoever attentively considers the different departments of power
 must perceive that in a government in which they are separated
 from each other the judiciary from the nature of its functions
 will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the
 constitution because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or
 may now and then proceed from the courts of justice the general
 liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter i
 mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the
 legislature and the executive for i agree that there is no
 liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the
 legislative authority such for instance as that it shall pass no
 bills of attainder no expostfacto laws and the like
 limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way
 than through the medium of courts of justice whose duty it must be
 to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the
 principal that the servant is above his master that the
 representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves
 that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their
 powers do not authorize but what they forbid
if it be said that the legislative body are themselves the
 two that which has the superior obligation and validity ought of
 course to be preferred or in other words the constitution ought
 to be preferred to the statute the intention of the people to the
 intention of their agents
nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of
 matter of necessity to give effect to one in exclusion of the other 
 the rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their
 relative validity is that the last in order of time shall be
 preferred to the first but this is a mere rule of construction
 not derived from any positive law but from the nature and reason of
 of a repugnancy may substitute their own pleasure to the
 constitutional intentions of the legislature this might as well
 happen in the case of two contradictory statutes or it might as
 well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute the
 courts must declare the sense of the law and if they should be
 information and more deliberate reflection have a tendency in the
 meantime to occasion dangerous innovations in the government and
 serious oppressions of the minor party in the community though i
 trust the friends of the proposed constitution will never concur
 with its enemies in questioning that fundamental principle of
 fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of
 the constitution where legislative invasions of it had been
 instigated by the major voice of the community
but it is not with a view to infractions of the constitution
 only that the independence of the judges may be an essential
 they may have disappointed they must have commanded the esteem and
 applause of all the virtuous and disinterested considerate men of
 every description ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or
 fortify that temper in the courts as no man can be sure that he
 may not be tomorrow the victim of a spirit of injustice by which
 popularity to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted
 but the constitution and the laws
there is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency
 of the judicial offices which is deducible from the nature of the
 qualifications they require it has been frequently remarked with
 government can have no great option between fit character and that
 a temporary duration in office which would naturally discourage
 such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept
 a seat on the bench would have a tendency to throw the
 administration of justice into hands less able and less well

 tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial and unbiased
the first point depends upon this obvious consideration that
 there ought always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy
 to constitutional provisions what for instance would avail
 restrictions on the authority of the state legislatures without
 things as political axioms the propriety of the judicial power of a
 government being coextensive with its legislative may be ranked
 among the number the mere necessity of uniformity in the
 interpretation of the national laws decides the question thirteen
 independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes
 the public faith than to the security of the public tranquillity
 a distinction may perhaps be imagined between cases arising upon
 treaties and the laws of nations and those which may stand merely on
 the footing of the municipal law the former kind may be supposed
 proper for the federal jurisdiction the latter for that of the
 horrid picture of the dissensions and private wars which distracted
 and desolated germany prior to the institution of the imperial
 chamber by maximilian towards the close of the fifteenth century
 and informs us at the same time of the vast influence of that
 institution in appeasing the disorders and establishing the
 provided against whatever practices may have a tendency to disturb
 the harmony between the states are proper objects of federal
 superintendence and control
it may be esteemed the basis of the union that the citizens
 of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities
 disposition to deny the national judiciary the cognizances of
 maritime causes these so generally depend on the laws of nations
 and so commonly affect the rights of foreigners that they fall
 within the considerations which are relative to the public peace
 the most important part of them are by the present confederation
 feel a strong predilection to the claims of their own government
having thus laid down and discussed the principles which ought
 to regulate the constitution of the federal judiciary we will
 proceed to test by these principles the particular powers of
 which according to the plan of the convention it is to be composed 
 proper for the jurisdiction of the united states it has been
 asked what is meant by cases arising under the constitution in
 contradiction from those arising under the laws of the united
 states the difference has been already explained all the
 restrictions upon the authority of the state legislatures furnish
 in which though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit
 sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law yet there may have
 been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the
 necessities or misfortunes of one of the parties which a court of
 equity would not tolerate in such cases where foreigners were
 causes proper for the cognizance of the national courts
fourth to controversies to which the united states shall be
 a party these constitute the third of those classes
fifth to controversies between two or more states between
 a state and citizens of another state between citizens of
 perfection of the system if some partial inconviences should
 appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into
 the plan it ought to be recollected that the national legislature
 will have ample authority to make such exceptions and to prescribe
 such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these
 establish
that there ought to be one court of supreme and final
 jurisdiction is a proposition which is not likely to be contested
 the reasons for it have been assigned in another place and are too
 obvious to need repetition the only question that seems to have
 legislative body this is as unprecedented as it is dangerous in
 britain the judical power in the last resort resides in the house
 of lords which is a branch of the legislature and this part of
 the british government has been imitated in the state constitutions
 in general the parliament of great britain and the legislatures
 is true is equally applicable to most if not to all the state
 governments there can be no objection therefore on this account
 to the federal judicature which will not lie against the local
 judicatures in general and which will not serve to condemn every
 constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative discretion
 same spirit which had operated in making them would be too apt in
 interpreting them still less could it be expected that men who had
 infringed the constitution in the character of legislators would be
 disposed to repair the breach in the character of judges nor is
 this all every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior
 marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle the voice
 both of law and of equity
these considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those
 states who have committed the judicial power in the last resort
 not to a part of the legislature but to distinct and independent
 thing on the general principles of law and reason is the sole
 obstacle a legislature without exceeding its province cannot
 reverse a determination once made in a particular case though it
 may prescribe a new rule for future cases this is the principle
 and it applies in all its consequences exactly in the same manner
 of determining upon them in the other would give to that body upon
 the members of the judicial department this is alone a complete
 security there never can be danger that the judges by a series of
 deliberate usurpations on the authority of the legislature would
 hazard the united resentment of the body intrusted with it while
but why it is asked might not the same purpose have been
 accomplished by the instrumentality of the state courts this
 admits of different answers though the fitness and competency of
 those courts should be allowed in the utmost latitude yet the
 substance of the power in question may still be regarded as a
 necessity for confiding the original cognizance of causes arising
 under those laws to them there would be a correspondent necessity
 for leaving the door of appeal as wide as possible in proportion
 to the grounds of confidence in or distrust of the subordinate
 tribunals ought to be the facility or difficulty of appeals and
 found in the proposed constitution
these reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind that the
 want of such a power would have been a great defect in the plan
 let us now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be
 distributed between the supreme and the inferior courts of the union
 which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds it has
 been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one
 state to the citizens of another would enable them to prosecute
 that state in the federal courts for the amount of those securities
 a suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without
 and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign
 and have no pretensions to a compulsive force they confer no right
 of action independent of the sovereign will to what purpose would
 it be to authorize suits against states for the debts they owe how
 could recoveries be enforced it is evident it could not be done
 language and forms which obtain in our courts have been induced to
 consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury in favor
 of the civillaw mode of trial which prevails in our courts of
 admiralty probate and chancery a technical sense has been
 affixed to the term appellate which in our law parlance is
 proposed constitution it may be so regulated as to be done by a
 second jury either by remanding the cause to the court below for a
 second trial of the fact or by directing an issue immediately out
 of the supreme court
but it does not follow that the reexamination of a fact once
the following train of ideas may well be imagined to have
 influenced the convention in relation to this particular provision
 the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court it may have been
 argued will extend to causes determinable in different modes some
 in the course of the common law others in the course of the civil
 enable the government to modify it in such a manner as will best
 answer the ends of public justice and security
this view of the matter at any rate puts it out of all doubt
 that the supposed abolition of the trial by jury by the operation
 of this provision is fallacious and untrue the legislature of the
 which may be thought advisable that this appellate jurisdiction
 does in no case abolish the trial by jury and that an ordinary
 degree of prudence and integrity in the national councils will
 insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposed
 judiciary without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which
federalist no

to the people of the state of new york
 which are certainly entitled to attention
the principles established in a former paper teach us that
 the states will retain all preexisting authorities which may not be
 exclusively delegated to the federal head and that this exclusive
 delegation can only exist in one of three cases where an exclusive
 and establish this might either be construed to signify that
 the supreme and subordinate courts of the union should alone have
 the power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to
 extend or simply to denote that the organs of the national
 judiciary should be one supreme court and as many subordinate
 the objects intrusted to their direction may not commit the
 decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the
 federal courts solely if such a measure should be deemed expedient
 but i hold that the state courts will be divested of no part of
 their primitive jurisdiction further than may relate to an appeal
here another question occurs what relation would subsist
 between the national and state courts in these instances of
 concurrent jurisdiction i answer that an appeal would certainly
 lie from the latter to the supreme court of the united states the
 constitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the
 the courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to
 the execution of the laws of the union and an appeal from them will
 as naturally lie to that tribunal which is destined to unite and
 assimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of
 national decisions the evident aim of the plan of the convention
 in such inferior courts as congress shall ordain and establish
 and it then proceeds to enumerate the cases to which this judicial
 power shall extend it afterwards divides the jurisdiction of the
 supreme court into original and appellate but gives no definition
 of that of the subordinate courts the only outlines described for

 matter or to demonstrate any of those propositions which by their
 own internal evidence force conviction when expressed in language
 adapted to convey their meaning
with regard to civil causes subtleties almost too contemptible
 for refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a
 ask if it is consistent with commonsense to suppose that a
 provision obliging the legislative power to commit the trial of
 criminal causes to juries is a privation of its right to authorize
 or permit that mode of trial in other cases is it natural to
 suppose that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the
 should be thought proper the pretense therefore that the
 national legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all the
 civil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries
 is a pretense destitute of all just foundation
from these observations this conclusion results that the trial
 affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd as well as
 useless if a general authority was intended
in like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures
 is declared by the constitution to comprehend certain cases
 particularly specified the expression of those cases marks the
 determines the particular mode which she is for that purpose to
 avail herself of but let us further suppose that in a subsequent
 part of the same act it should be declared that no woman should
 dispose of any estate of a determinate value without the consent of
 three of her nearest relations signified by their signing the deed
 they will remain determinable as heretofore by the state courts
 only and in the manner which the state constitutions and laws
 prescribe all land causes except where claims under the grants of
 different states come into question and all other controversies
 between the citizens of the same state unless where they depend
 altogether superfluous to examine to what extent it deserves to be
 esteemed useful or essential in a representative republic or how
 much more merit it may be entitled to as a defense against the
 oppressions of an hereditary monarch than as a barrier to the
 tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government discussions
 legislature in regard to the amount of taxes to be laid to the
 objects upon which they are to be imposed or to the rule by which
 they are to be apportioned if it can have any influence
 therefore it must be upon the mode of collection and the conduct
 of the officers intrusted with the execution of the revenue laws
 circumstances of the case
the excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to
 depend on circumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty the
 strongest argument in its favor is that it is a security against
 corruption as there is always more time and better opportunity to
 a valuable check upon corruption it greatly multiplies the
 impediments to its success as matters now stand it would be
 necessary to corrupt both court and jury for where the jury have
 gone evidently wrong the court will generally grant a new trial
 and it would be in most cases of little use to practice upon the
 difficulty in this and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be
 sensible that in a federal government which is a composition of
 societies whose ideas and institutions in relation to the matter
 materially vary from each other that difficulty must be not a
 little augmented for my own part at every new view i take of the
 proceeds like ours but neither courts of admiralty nor of probates
 in the sense in which these last are established with us in that
 state the courts of common law have the cognizance of those causes
 which with us are determinable in the courts of admiralty and of
 probates and of course the jury trial is more extensive in new
 have admiralty and to a certain extent equity jurisdiction in
 cases of importance their general assembly is the only court of
 chancery in connecticut therefore the trial by jury extends in
 practice further than in any other state yet mentioned rhode
 island is i believe in this particular pretty much in the
 provision altogether and leaving the matter as has been done to
 legislative regulation
the propositions which have been made for supplying the omission
 have rather served to illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of
 the thing the minority of pennsylvania have proposed this mode of
 in the state where the courts sat that mode of trial would obtain
 in a similar case in the state courts that is to say admiralty
 causes should be tried in connecticut by a jury in new york without
 one the capricious operation of so dissimilar a method of trial in
 the same cases under the same government is of itself sufficient
 infringed by their decisions so as to afford occasions of reprisal
 and war though the proper province of juries be to determine
 matters of fact yet in most cases legal consequences are
 complicated with fact in such a manner as to render a separation
 impracticable
 is to give relief in extraordinary cases which are exceptions
 to general rules to unite the jurisdiction of such cases with the
 ordinary jurisdiction must have a tendency to unsettle the general
 rules and to subject every case that arises to a special
 determination while a separation of the one from the other has the
 but it is equally true that the trial by jury has been unknown in
 every case in which they have been united and the separation is
 essential to the preservation of that institution in its pristine
 purity the nature of a court of equity will readily permit the
 extension of its jurisdiction to matters of law but it is not a
 request it
this at best is a proposition confined to one description of
 causes and the inference is fair either that the massachusetts
 convention considered that as the only class of federal causes in
 which the trial by jury would be proper or that if desirous of a
 foundation every action may be considered as an action at common
 law to be determined by a jury if the parties or either of them
 choose it hence the same irregularity and confusion would be
 introduced by a compliance with this proposition that i have
 already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the
 be a good one as a standard for the united states i answer that
 it is not very probable the other states would entertain the same
 opinion of our institutions as we do ourselves it is natural to
 suppose that they are hitherto more attached to their own and that
 each would struggle for the preference if the plan of taking one
 the trial by jury ought to embrace it is sometimes suggested by men
 of enthusiastic tempers that a provision might have been inserted
 for establishing it in all cases whatsoever for this i believe no
 precedent is to be found in any member of the union and the
 considerations which have been stated in discussing the proposition
 the great body of the community is interested that mode of trial
 will remain in its full force as established in the state
 constitutions untouched and unaffected by the plan of the
 convention that it is in no case abolished by that plan and
 that there are great if not insurmountable difficulties in the way
 propriety and utility of other exceptions i suspect it to be
 impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at
 which the operation of the institution ought to stop and this is
 with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion
 of the legislature
 government
it certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to
 affirm that there is no security for liberty in a constitution which
 expressly establishes the trial by jury in criminal cases because
 it does not do it in civil also while it is a notorious fact that
federalist no 
certain general and miscellaneous objections to the constitution
 considered and answered
from mcleans edition new york
hamilton
 partisans of a bill of rights to justify their zeal in this
 matter they allege two things one is that though the
 constitution of new york has no bill of rights prefixed to it yet
 it contains in the body of it various provisions in favor of
 particular privileges and rights which in substance amount to the
 clause  no bill of attainder or expostfacto law shall be
 passed clause  no title of nobility shall be granted by the
 united states and no person holding any office of profit or trust
 under them shall without the consent of the congress accept of
 any present emolument office or title of any kind whatever from
 constitution of this state the establishment of the writ of
 habeas corpus the prohibition of expostfacto laws and of
 titles of nobility to which we have no corresponding provision in
 our constitution are perhaps greater securities to liberty and
 republicanism than any it contains the creation of crimes after
nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the
 prohibition of titles of nobility this may truly be denominated
 the cornerstone of republican government for so long as they are
 excluded there can never be serious danger that the government will
 be any other than that of the people
 the subsequent confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes
 such was the petition of right assented to by charles i in the
 beginning of his reign such also was the declaration of right
 presented by the lords and commons to the prince of orange in 
 and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament called
 nation than to a constitution which has the regulation of every
 species of personal and private concerns if therefore the loud
 clamors against the plan of the convention on this score are well
 founded no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the
 constitution of this state but the truth is that both of them
 abuse of an authority which was not given and that the provision
 against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear
 implication that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning
 it was intended to be vested in the national government this may
 serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to
 our rights
there remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the
 point the truth is after all the declamations we have heard that
 the constitution is itself in every rational sense and to every
 useful purpose a bill of rights the several bills of rights in
 propriety be contended that there is no such thing it certainly
 must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of
 declaring the rights of the citizens if they are to be found in any
 part of the instrument which establishes the government and hence
 it must be apparent that much of what has been said on this subject
 imagination what are the sources of information by which the
 people in montgomery county must regulate their judgment of the
 conduct of their representatives in the state legislature of
 personal observation they can have no benefit this is confined to
 the citizens on the spot they must therefore depend on the
 intelligence they can never be at a loss to know the behavior of
 those who represent their constituents in the national councils and
 can readily communicate the same knowledge to the people their
 disposition to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its
 interests from another quarter may be relied upon if it were only
 debts due to the united states this has been represented as a
 tacit relinquishment of those debts and as a wicked contrivance to
 screen public defaulters the newspapers have teemed with the most
 inflammatory railings on this head yet there is nothing clearer
 than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation the
 the national head and that these require a different organization
 of the federal government a single body being an unsafe depositary
 of such ample authorities in conceding all this the question of
 expense must be given up for it is impossible with any degree of
 safety to narrow the foundation upon which the system is to stand
 board of treasury consisting of three persons a treasurer
 assistants clerks etc these officers are indispensable under any
 system and will suffice under the new as well as the old as to
 ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries the
 proposed constitution can make no other difference than to render
 been represented to us the chief item which occurs to me respects
 the support of the judges of the united states i do not add the
 president because there is now a president of congress whose
 expenses may not be far if any thing short of those which will be
 incurred on account of the president of the united states the
 senate from this circumstance we may infer that until the house
 of representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present
 number there will be a considerable saving of expense from the
 difference between the constant session of the present and the
 temporary session of the future congress
 affairs of their particular states and will not have to sit in any
 proportion as long as they have heretofore done this difference in
 the time of the sessions of the state legislatures will be clear
 gain and will alone form an article of saving which may be
 regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expense that
 state constitutions in favor of the freedom of the press would be
 a constitutional impediment to the imposition of duties upon
 publications by the state legislatures it cannot certainly be
 pretended that any degree of duties however low would be an
 abridgment of the liberty of the press  we know that newspapers
to the people of the state of new york
according to the formal division of the subject of these papers
 announced in my first number there would appear still to remain for
 discussion two points the analogy of the proposed government to
 your own state constitution and the additional security which
 consistency who can rail at the latter for imperfections which he
 finds no difficulty in excusing in the former nor indeed can there
 be a better proof of the insincerity and affectation of some of the
 zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention among us who
 profess to be the devoted admirers of the government under which
 titles of nobility and in the precautions against the repetition
 of those practices on the part of the state governments which have
 undermined the foundations of property and credit have planted
 mutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens and have
 occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals
 which have been in various ways practiced to keep the truth from the
 public eye have been of a nature to demand the reprobation of all
 honest men it is not impossible that these circumstances may have
 occasionally betrayed me into intemperances of expression which i
 did not intend it is certain that i have frequently felt a
 posterity an improper election of the part he is to act let him
 beware of an obstinate adherence to party let him reflect that the
 object upon which he is to decide is not a particular interest of
 the community but the very existence of the nation and let him
 remember that a majority of america has already given its sanction
 interests of the community cannot be safely confided to it this
 as far as i have understood the meaning of those who make the
 concessions is an entire perversion of their sense no advocate of
 the measure can be found who will not declare as his sentiment
 that the system though it may not be perfect in every part is
the reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately
 published in this city are unanswerable to show the utter
 improbability of assembling a new convention under circumstances in
 any degree so favorable to a happy issue as those in which the late
 convention met deliberated and concluded i will not repeat the
 states here then the chances are as thirteen to nine in
 favor of subsequent amendment rather than of the original adoption
 of an entire system
this is not all every constitution for the united states must
 inevitably consist of a great variety of particulars in which
 relation to any other point no giving nor taking the will of the
 requisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue
 and consequently whenever nine or rather ten states were united
 in the desire of a particular amendment that amendment must
 infallibly take place there can therefore be no comparison
 constituents but there is yet a further consideration which
 proves beyond the possibility of a doubt that the observation is
 futile it is this that the national rulers whenever nine states
 concur will have no option upon the subject by the fifth article
 of the plan the congres will be obliged on the application of the
 myself deceived by it for it is in my conception one of those
 rare instances in which a political truth can be brought to the test
 of a mathematical demonstration those who see the matter in the
