 nothing less than the existence of the union the safety and welfare
 of the parts of which it is composed the fate of an empire in many
 affects too many particular interests innovates upon too many local
 institutions not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects
 foreign to its merits and of views passions and prejudices little

 at least if not respectablethe honest errors of minds led astray
 by preconceived jealousies and fears so numerous indeed and so
and yet however just these sentiments will be allowed to be we
 have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as
 in all former cases of great national discussion a torrent of
 dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal
 for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of
 zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government history will
 acknowledge to you my convictions and i will freely lay before you
 the reasons on which they are founded the consciousness of good
 intentions disdains ambiguity i shall not however multiply

concerning dangers from foreign force and influence
it has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion
 that the prosperity of the people of america depended on their
 continuing firmly united and the wishes prayers and efforts of
 accommodation of its inhabitants a succession of navigable waters
 forms a kind of chain round its borders as if to bind it together
 while the most noble rivers in the world running at convenient
 uniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere
 enjoying the same national rights privileges and protection as a
 nation we have made peace and war as a nation we have vanquished
 security for both could only be found in a national government more
 wisely framed they as with one voice convened the late convention
 at philadelphia to take that important subject under consideration
 apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of america to
 form the memorable congress of  that body recommended certain
 measures to their constituents and the event proved their wisdom
 liberty and prosperity and therefore that it was not less their
 inclination than their duty to recommend only such measures as
 after the most mature deliberation they really thought prudent and
 great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to
 adopt with what propriety therefore or for what good purposes
 are attempts at this particular period made by some men to

 dangers from foreign arms and influence as from dangers of the like
 kind arising from domestic causes as the former of these comes

 and britain and with respect to the two latter has in addition
 the circumstance of neighborhood to attend to

 well as more safe with respect to us
because under the national government treaties and articles of
 disposed to resist such temptations yet as such temptations may
 and commonly do result from circumstances peculiar to the state
 and may affect a great number of the inhabitants the governing
 as it is but there are several instances of indian hostilities
 having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual states
 who either unable or unwilling to restrain or punish offenses have
 such cases will not be affected by this pride but will proceed
 with moderation and candor to consider and decide on the means most
 proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them
my last paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the
 people would be best secured by union against the danger it may be
 exposed to by just causes of war given to other nations and those
 the sovereign often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by
 justice or the voice and interests of his people but independent
 of these inducements to war which are more prevalent in absolute
the extension of our own commerce in our own vessels cannot give
 pleasure to any nations who possess territories on or near this
 continent because the cheapness and excellence of our productions
 obvious at present and that whenever such inducements may find fit
 time and opportunity for operation pretenses to color and justify
 them will not be wanting wisely therefore do they consider union
 defense of any particular part and that more easily and
 expeditiously than state governments or separate confederacies can
 possibly do for want of concert and unity of system it can place

 they were for ages divided into three and that those three were
 almost constantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another
 notwithstanding their true interest with respect to the continental
 them so at first but admitting that to be practicable yet what
 human contrivance can secure the continuance of such equality
 independent of those local circumstances which tend to beget and
 but also to feel a disposition equally unfavorable to them
 distrust naturally creates distrust and by nothing is goodwill
 and kind conduct more speedily changed than by invidious jealousies
 formidable only to each other
from these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are
 greatly mistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive
 would not therefore be easy to form nor if formed would it be
 observed and fulfilled with perfect good faith

concerning dangers from dissensions between the states
 ambitious vindictive and rapacious to look for a continuation of
 harmony between a number of independent unconnected sovereignties
 in the same neighborhood would be to disregard the uniform course
the celebrated pericles in compliance with the resentment of a
 prostitute at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of
 his countrymen attacked vanquished and destroyed the city of the
 independence as well of the kingdom over which he presided by his
 counsels as of europe in general for if there ever was a
 sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal monarchy
 be doubted whether massachusetts would have been plunged into a
 civil war
but notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience in
 former administered by men as well as the latter are there not
 aversions predilections rivalships and desires of unjust
 acquisitions that affect nations as well as kings are not popular
 monarchies of the same times sparta was little better than a
 wellregulated camp and rome was never sated of carnage and
 conquest
 nevertheless have been more frequently engaged in war and the
 wars in which that kingdom has been engaged have in numerous
 instances proceeded from the people
 whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own what
 reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce
 us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members
 that it has from long observation of the progress of society become
 a sort of axiom in politics that vicinity or nearness of situation
 constitutes nations natural enemies an intelligent writer

territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the
 an acquisition to the confederacy by compact with a foreign power
 it has been the prudent policy of congress to appease this
 controversy by prevailing upon the states to make cessions to the
 principles would be set up by different states for this purpose
 and as they would affect the opposite interests of the parties
 they might not easily be susceptible of a pacific adjustment
 like individuals acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations
 to their disadvantage
those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the
 our growing greatness in a review of these transactions we may
 trace some of the causes which would be likely to embroil the states
 with each other if it should be their unpropitious destiny to
 regulations of trade by which particular states might endeavor to
 secure exclusive benefits to their own citizens the infractions of
 these regulations on one side the efforts to prevent and repel
 odious to our neighbors and in their opinion so oppressive
 should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent weight of
 connecticut on the one side and the cooperating pressure of new
 state in the total amount of the national debt would be strenuous
 for some equitable and effective provision the procrastinations of
 the former would excite the resentments of the latter the
 still delinquencies in payments on the part of some of the states
 would result from a diversity of other causesthe real deficiency of
 resources the mismanagement of their finances accidental
 disgracing their several codes we have observed the disposition to
 retaliation excited in connecticut in consequence of the enormities
 perpetrated by the legislature of rhode island and we reasonably

 possible be laid before the public it is proposed to publish them

 have long obtained the disciplined armies always kept on foot on
 the continent of europe though they bear a malignant aspect to
 liberty and economy have notwithstanding been productive of the
in this country the scene would be altogether reversed the
 jealousy of military establishments would postpone them as long as
 possible the want of fortifications leaving the frontiers of one
 correspondent appendages of military establishments standing
 armies it is said are not provided against in the new
 constitution and it is therefore inferred that they may exist
 under vigorous governments and with the assistance of disciplined
 armies have often triumphed over large states or states of greater
 natural strength which have been destitute of these advantages
 equally satisfactory may be given to this question the
 industrious habits of the people of the present day absorbed in the
 pursuits of gain and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and
 relaxations in favor of military exigencies the civil state
 remains in full vigor neither corrupted nor confounded with the
 principles or propensities of the other state the smallness of the
 frequent infringements on their rights which serve to weaken their
 sense of those rights and by degrees the people are brought to
 consider the soldiery not only as their protectors but as their
 prevalent venality and corruption if on the contrary britain had
 been situated on the continent and had been compelled as she would
 have been by that situation to make her military establishments at
 ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other
this is an idea not superficial or futile but solid and weighty 
 it deserves the most serious and mature consideration of every

 so justly celebrated
from the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics
 the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments not only against
 the regular distribution of power into distinct departments the
 introduction of legislative balances and checks the institution of
 courts composed of judges holding their offices during good
 external force and security is in reality not a new idea it has
 been practiced upon in different countries and ages and has
 received the sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of
 universal pity or contempt some of the writers who have come
 forward on the other side of the question seem to have been aware of
 the dilemma and have even been bold enough to hint at the division
 monarchy with those of republicanism
it is very probable says he that mankind would
 have been obliged at length to live constantly under the government
 forces independent of those which he had usurped and overpower him
 before he could be settled in his usurpation
should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate
 essential characteristic of the first is said to be the restriction
 of its authority to the members in their collective capacities
 without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed it
 separate organization of the members be not abolished so long as
 it exists by a constitutional necessity for local purposes
 though it should be in perfect subordination to the general
 republic it would be that of lycia thus we perceive that the
 distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this
 enlightened civilian and we shall be led to conclude that they
 attached provides a proper cure for it the instability
 injustice and confusion introduced into the public councils have
 in truth been the mortal diseases under which popular governments
 which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our
 governments but it will be found at the same time that other
 causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes
 fire an aliment without which it instantly expires but it could
 not be less folly to abolish liberty which is essential to
 political life because it nourishes faction than it would be to
 and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of
 activity according to the different circumstances of civil society
 a zeal for different opinions concerning religion concerning
 different classes actuated by different sentiments and views the
 regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the
 principal task of modern legislation and involves the spirit of
 questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the
 manufacturing classes and probably by neither with a sole regard to
 justice and the public good the apportionment of taxes on the
 defeat its sinister views by regular vote it may clog the
 administration it may convulse the society but it will be unable
 to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the constitution 
 to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals and lose
 their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together that
 is in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful
 representation takes place opens a different prospect and promises
 the cure for which we are seeking let us examine the points in
 which it varies from pure democracy and we shall comprehend both
 or by other means first obtain the suffrages and then betray the
 interests of the people the question resulting is whether small
 or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper
 likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and
 the most diffusive and established characters
it must be confessed that in this as in most other cases there

 the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of
 oppression extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of
 able to outnumber and oppress the rest in an equal degree does the

 occasion a considerable deduction would not so circuitous an
 nations toward us in this respect would arise from the
 establishment of a federal navy there can be no doubt that the
 continuance of the union under an efficient government would put it
but in the reverse of this eligible situation we shall discover
 that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each
 other and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature
 might operate with success it would be in the power of the
 maritime nations availing themselves of our universal impotence to
 prescribe the conditions of our political existence and as they

 than a navy of any single state or partial confederacy which would
 only embrace the resources of a single part it happens indeed

 states have been sufficiently delineated its tendency to promote
 the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry

 the products of the earth which furnishes new incitements to the
 cultivation of land which is the most powerful instrument in

 want of the fostering influence of commerce that monarch can boast
 but slender revenues he has several times been compelled to owe
no person acquainted with what happens in other countries will
 be surprised at this circumstance in so opulent a nation as that
 of britain where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much
 of a general union as far as this would be conducive to the
 interests of commerce so far it must tend to the extension of the
 revenue to be drawn from that source as far as it would contribute
 found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous stratagems of
 avarice
in france there is an army of patrols as they are called
 of detection as well after as before their arrival at the places of
 their final destination an ordinary degree of vigilance would be
 competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the

it is therefore evident that one national government would be

what will be the consequence if we are not able to avail
 ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent a nation

 must be satisfied in some mode or other the defect of other
 resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on the

 usefully applied to another and there will be so much the less to
 be drawn from the pockets of the people if the states are united
 requires the same energy of government and the same forms of
 administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent
 this idea admits not of precise demonstration because there is no
 conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different states
 we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most
 naturally league themselves under two governments the four eastern
 consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned towards
 the weaker power of the southern rather than towards the stronger
 power of the northern confederacy this would give her the fairest
 nations into which the states would be divided we shall clearly
 discover that a separation would be not less injurious to the
 economy than to the tranquillity commerce revenue and liberty of
 extent of country which the union embraces a few observations on
 this subject will be the more proper as it is perceived that the
 adversaries of the new constitution are availing themselves of the
 either of an absolute or limited monarchy they have endeavored to
 heighten the advantages or palliate the evils of those forms by
 placing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican and
 in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her

in the first place it is to be remembered that the general
 government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and
 our territory which lie on our northwestern frontier must be left

 equal to the task
 foreign nations and will consequently stand on particular
 occasions in greatest need of its strength and resources it may

 principal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are

 are we entitled by nature and compact to a free participation in
 of money to shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford
 neither pleasure nor instruction it may in general be demanded
 what indication is there of national disorder poverty and
 strenuous opposition to a remedy upon the only principles that can
 give it a chance of success while they admit that the government
 of the united states is destitute of energy they contend against
 efficacy of the rest depends except as to the rule of appointment
 the united states has an indefinite discretion to make requisitions
 for men and money but they have no authority to raise either by
 the parties compacts of this kind exist among all civilized
 nations subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and war of
 observance and nonobservance as the interests or passions of the
 towards a confederate government this would bring us to a simple
 alliance offensive and defensive and would place us in a situation
 to be alternate friends and enemies of each other as our mutual
 magistracy or by the coercion of arms the first kind can
 evidently apply only to men the last kind must of necessity be
 employed against bodies politic or communities or states it is
 it at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which
 human conduct is actuated and belied the original inducements to
 the establishment of civil power why has government been

 writers
 influential state should happen to be the aggressing member it
 would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win over
 some of them as associates to its cause specious arguments of
 extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace of
 submission the first war of this kind would probably terminate in
 a dissolution of the union
 sufficient certainty to justify the harsh expedient of compulsion
 it is easy to see that this problem alone as often as it should
 occur would open a wide field for the exercise of factious views
 movements by laws to operate upon them in their collective
 capacities and to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in
 the same capacities a project of this kind is little less romantic
 empowered to employ the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute
 its own resolutions the majesty of the national authority must be
 manifested through the medium of the courts of justice the
 unsubstantial provisions so as not to appear and of course not to
 excite any alarm in the people for the safety of the constitution
 the state leaders may even make a merit of their surreptitious
 supreme law of the land unconstitutional and void if the people
 were not tainted with the spirit of their state representatives
 they as the natural guardians of the constitution would throw
 mortal feuds which in certain conjunctures spread a conflagration
 through a whole nation or through a very large proportion of it
 proceeding either from weighty causes of discontent given by the
 citizens of america it may be said that it would tend to render
 the government of the union too powerful and to enable it to absorb
 those residuary authorities which it might be judged proper to
 powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory and the
 possession of them for that reason would contribute nothing to the
 dignity to the importance or to the splendor of the national
 governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of
 the national government but chiefly from the nature of the objects
 to which the attention of the state administrations would be
 the state governments which alone suffices to place the matter in a
 clear and satisfactory lighti mean the ordinary administration of
 criminal and civil justice this of all others is the most
 they will be less apt to come home to the feelings of the people

 obligation and an active sentiment of attachment

 clanship which was at an early day introduced into that kingdom
 uniting the nobles and their dependants by ties equivalent to those
 governments will further illustrate this important doctrine an
 inattention to which has been the great source of our political
 mistakes and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side

 members to fine the aggressing party to employ the whole force

 capacities and exercised over them in the same capacities hence
 the weakness the disorders and finally the destruction of the
 confederacy the more powerful members instead of being kept in
 masters of the public deliberations vigorously opposed and defeated
 the attempt this piece of history proves at once the inefficiency
 of the union the ambition and jealousy of its most powerful

 amphictyonic council according to the superstition of the age
 imposed a fine on the sacrilegious offenders the phocians being
 grecian republics which supplies us with valuable instruction
the union here was far more intimate and its organization much
 wiser than in the preceding instance it will accordingly appear
 compelled to receive the same laws and usages when lacedaemon was
 brought into the league by philopoemen it was attended with an
 abolition of the institutions and laws of lycurgus and an adoption
 in the members of the achaean republic because it was there
 tempered by the general authority and laws of the confederacy
we are not to conclude too hastily however that faction did
 from stopping it all greece caught the enthusiasm and seemed ready
 to unite in one confederacy when the jealousy and envy in sparta

 revolt of messene one of its members being joined by the aetolians

i have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this
 important portion of history both because it teaches more than one
 presents itself is the germanic body
in the early ages of christianity germany was occupied by seven
 distinct nations who had no common chief the franks one of the
 the suabian and the accession of the first emperor of the austrian
 lines in the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full
 sovereignty in the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols
 mutual intercourse without the consent of the emperor and diet
 from altering the value of money from doing injustice to one
 another or from affording assistance or retreat to disturbers of
 supposition would be that it must form an exception to the general
 character which belongs to its kindred systems nothing would be
 further from the reality the fundamental principle on which it
 imperial sovereign and commonly proved an overmatch for him
 controversies and wars among the members themselves have been so
 common that the german annals are crowded with the bloody pages
 disproportionate contributions to the treasury

 among these sovereign subjects produced the experiment of dividing

 troops and finding it a fit occasion as he had secretly intended
 from the beginning to revive an antiquated claim on the pretext

 long considered themselves as interested in the changes made by
 events in this constitution and have on various occasions
 simple and homogeneous manners by their joint interest in their
 dependent possessions by the mutual aid they stand in need of for

 of these federal precedents experience is the oracle of truth
 the enumeration of the most important of those defects which have
 hitherto disappointed our hopes from the system established among
 ourselves to form a safe and satisfactory judgment of the proper
 provision which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies
 of those who oppose the new constitution and the want of which in
 that plan has been the subject of much plausible animadversion and

 common standard or barometer by which the degrees of it can be

 compliance with its requisitions could be devised the suffering
 states would not long consent to remain associated upon a principle
 which distributes the public burdens with so unequal a hand and
 time and things an equilibrium as far as it is attainable in so
 complicated a subject will be established everywhere or if
 inequalities should still exist they would neither be so great in
 which principally relate to land and buildings may admit of a rule
 of apportionment either the value of land or the number of the
 people may serve as a standard the state of agriculture and the

in addition to the defects already enumerated in the existing
 violated by its members and while they found from experience that
 they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets
 without granting us any return but such as their momentary
 it is to be feared that examples of this nature if not restrained
 by a national control would be multiplied and extended till they
 became not less serious sources of animosity and discord than
 men in order to furnish the quotas required of them they outbid
 each other till bounties grew to an enormous and insupportable size
 the hope of a still further increase afforded an inducement to

 suggestions of justice and commonsense it may happen that this
 majority of states is a small minority of the people of

 less than a majority of the people  and it is constitutionally
 possible that these nine may give the vote besides there are

 royal prostitution though there have been abundant specimens of
 disgust in the nation and was a principal cause that the most

the necessity of a government as energetic as the one proposed to
 the superintendence of our intercourse political and commercial
 with foreign countries
the authorities essential to the common defense are these to
 which it is to be attained
whether there ought to be a federal government intrusted with
 the care of the common defense is a question in the first instance
 constitutionally binding upon the states who are in fact under the
 most solemn obligations to furnish the supplies required of them
 the intention evidently was that the united states should command
 and support of an army and navy in the customary and ordinary modes
 practiced in other governments
if the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a
 trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled
 from managing them with vigor and success
who is likely to make suitable provisions for the public
 revolution which we have just accomplished
every view we may take of the subject as candid inquirers after
 truth will serve to convince us that it is both unwise and
 unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers the powers are not
 too extensive for the objects of federal administration or in
 other words for the management of our national interests nor can
 clear a light as any matter still in the womb of time and experience
 can be susceptible of this at all events must be evident that
 the very difficulty itself drawn from the extent of the country is
 objection which i shall now endeavor to show rests on weak and
 unsubstantial foundations
it has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general
if he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself he would be
 surprised to discover that neither the one nor the other was the
 case that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the
 all this apprehension and clamor
if under this impression he proceeded to pass in review the
 several state constitutions how great would be his disappointment
if he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey
 of the articles of confederation his astonishment would not only be
 increased but would acquire a mixture of indignation at the
 question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients so
 unfriendly to an impartial and right determination even such a man
 could hardly forbear remarking that a conduct of this kind has too
 their american possessions and in relation to us a common interest
 the savage tribes on our western frontier ought to be regarded as
 our natural enemies their natural allies because they have most to
 permanent corps in the pay of the government the first is
 impracticable and if practicable would be pernicious the
 militia would not long if at all submit to be dragged from their
 increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which
 our western settlements might be annoyed there are and will be
 particular posts the possession of which will include the command

 collection of state constitutions pennsylvania and north carolina

 as it respected the other states various inconveniences would
 attend such a system the states to whose lot it might fall to
 support the necessary establishments would be as little able as
 government if in addition to this immense advantage the ambition
 of the members should be stimulated by the separate and independent
 possession of military forces it would afford too strong a
 each other than a due supply of the federal treasury and the system
 of quotas and requisitions
there are other lights besides those already taken notice of in
 to the national government and the matter would then be brought to
 this issue that the national government to provide against
 apprehended danger might in the first instance raise troops and
 the prohibition to the raising of armies in time of peace the
 united states would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle
 which the world has yet seen that of a nation incapacitated by its
 that might have been saved the facts which from our own
 experience forbid a reliance of this kind are too recent to permit
 us to be the dupes of such a suggestion the steady operations of
 keep them up as long as there is any appearance of danger to the
 public peace the conduct of massachusetts affords a lesson on the
 same subject though on different ground that state without

 judging that confidence must be placed somewhere that the
 necessity of doing it is implied in the very act of delegating
 power and that it is better to hazard the abuse of that confidence
 to the welfare and prosperity of the community
it may not be amiss in this place concisely to remark the origin
 and progress of the idea which aims at the exclusion of military
 exercise of so dangerous an authority it became an article of the
 bill of rights then framed that the raising or keeping a standing
 army within the kingdom in time of peace unless with the consent of
 quickened the public sensibility on every point connected with the
 security of popular rights and in some instances raise the warmth
 of our zeal beyond the degree which consisted with the due
 celebrated both in europe and america as one of the best of the
 forms of government established in this country there is a total
 silence upon the subject
 efficacy between the provision alluded to and that which is
 contained in the new constitution for restraining the
 appropriations of money for military purposes to the period of two
 the question comes forward the public attention will be roused and
 attracted to the subject by the party in opposition and if the
 majority should be really disposed to exceed the proper limits the
 variations in a representative body which biennial elections would
 naturally produce in both houses is it presumable that every man
 the instant he took his seat in the national senate or house of
it has been said that the provision which limits the
 appropriation of money for the support of an army to the period of
 two years would be unavailing because the executive when once
but it is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a
 united than in a disunited state nay it may be safely asserted
 that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter
 the kind proposed by the convention cannot operate without the aid
 of a military force to execute its laws this however like most
 other things that have been alleged on that side rests on mere
 demerits of a constitution these can only be judged of by general
 principles and maxims
various reasons have been suggested in the course of these
 eye the interior structure of the edifice which we are invited to
 erect it will be sufficient here to remark that until
 satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an opinion that the
 confederacy than to that of a single member
i will in this place hazard an observation which will not be
 the less just because to some it may appear new which is that the
 of mankind naturally flow the less will it require the aid of the
 violent and perilous expedients of compulsion
one thing at all events must be evident that a government
 will result from the important consideration of its having power to
 call to its assistance and support the resources of the whole union
 it merits particular attention in this place that the laws of the
 that the national rulers would be insensible to the motives of
 public good or to the obligations of duty i would still ask them
 how the interests of ambition or the views of encroachment can be
 politic as tumors and eruptions from the natural body that the
 idea of governing at all times by the simple force of law which we
 have been told is the only admissible principle of republican
 of force might become unavoidable it appears that massachusetts
 found it necessary to raise troops for repressing the disorders
 within that state that pennsylvania from the mere apprehension of
 frequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty
 republics
let us pursue this examination in another light suppose in
independent of all other reasonings upon the subject it is a
 full answer to those who require a more peremptory provision against
 military establishments in time of peace to say that the whole
 be for the people to form a regular or systematic plan of
 opposition and the more easy will it be to defeat their early
 efforts intelligence can be more speedily obtained of their
 make it preponderate if their rights are invaded by either they
 can make use of the other as the instrument of redress how wise
 will it be in them by cherishing the union to preserve to themselves

 fresh forces the advantages obtained in one place must be

concerning the militia
from the daily advertiser
 most evident propriety that the plan of the convention proposes to
 empower the union to provide for organizing arming and
 disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may
 of force if it cannot avail itself of the former it will be
 obliged to recur to the latter to render an army unnecessary will
 be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand
 of those laws as it would be to believe that a right to enact laws
 necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes
 would involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the
 government is impossible to be foreseen but so far from viewing
 the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps
 as dangerous were the constitution ratified and were i to deliver
 abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent
 would be unwise and the experiment if made could not succeed
 because it would not long be endured little more can reasonably be
 little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of
 arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their
 fellowcitizens this appears to me the only substitute that can be
 apprehension can be inferred from a power in the union to prescribe
 regulations for the militia and to command its services when
 necessary while the particular states are to have the sole and
 louis dors and ducats at one moment there is to be a large army
 to lay prostrate the liberties of the people at another moment the
 militia of virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or six

 power calculated to answer no end but to draw upon themselves

 contributed to reduce us to a situation which affords ample cause
 both of mortification to ourselves and of triumph to our enemies
 maxim of good sense and sound policy which dictates that every
 power ought to be in proportion to its object and would still
 leave the general government in a kind of tutelage to the state

 possess either energy or stability dignity or credit confidence at

 destruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming
 essential to the public safety to imagine that at such a crisis

the same subject continued
concerning the general power of taxation
 that there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect
 a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation and there are
 other truths in the two latter sciences which if they cannot
but in the sciences of morals and politics men are found far
 less tractable to a certain degree it is right and useful that
 this should be the case caution and investigation are a necessary
 recapitulated in this place as introductory to an examination of
 what may have been offered by way of objection to them they are in
 substance as follows
 necessity be invested with an unqualified power of taxation in the
 ordinary modes
did not experience evince the contrary it would be natural to
 but an indefinite power of taxation in the latter might and
 probably would in time deprive the former of the means of providing
 for their own necessities and would subject them entirely to the
 imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst
 the labyrinths of an enchanted castle and knows not on which side
 to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has
 governments to encroach upon the rights of the union is quite as
 probable as a disposition in the union to encroach upon the rights
 of the state governments what side would be likely to prevail in
 objections which have been made to an indefinite power of taxation
 in the united states
publius
 supply of their own wants and making this concession i affirm
 that with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports they
 would under the plan of the convention retain that authority in
 contradictory and repugnant i use these terms to distinguish this
 last case from another which might appear to resemble it but which
 would in fact be essentially different i mean where the exercise
 exported from any state in consequence of which qualification it
 now only extends to the duties on imports this answers to the
 second case the third will be found in that clause which declares
 taxes the authority of the states remains undiminished in any
 other view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous it would be
 unnecessary because if the grant to the union of the power of
 constitution would then be made to introduce a formal provision for
 the sake of a very absurd conclusion which is that the states
 with the consent of the national legislature might tax imports and
 finance might now and then not exactly coincide and might require
 reciprocal forbearances it is not however a mere possibility of
 inconvenience in the exercise of powers but an immediate
publius
federalist no 
the same subject continued
 invective and petulant declamation against the proposed constitution
 they have been held up to the people in all the exaggerated colors
 of misrepresentation as the pernicious engines by which their local
 a power of making laws what are the means to execute a legislative
 power but laws what is the power of laying and collecting taxes
 but a legislative power or a power of making laws to lay and
 called authorizes the national legislature to pass all necessary
 and proper laws if there is any thing exceptionable it must be
 sought for in the specific powers upon which this general
 propriety of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the
 union i answer first that this question arises as well and as
 fully upon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory
 jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which its
 constitution plainly supposes to exist in the state governments if
 there ever should be a doubt on this head the credit of it will be
 doctrine that acts of the large society which are not pursuant to
 its constitutional powers but which are invasions of the residuary
 authorities of the smaller societies will become the supreme law of
 mutual inconvenience not arising from a superiority or defect of
 power on either side but from an injudicious exercise of power by
 one or the other in a manner equally disadvantageous to both it
i flatter myself it has been clearly shown in my last number
 that the particular states under the proposed constitution would
 have coequal authority with the union in the article of revenue
 the other the plebian many arguments might have been adduced to
 prove the unfitness of two such seemingly contradictory authorities
 each having power to annul or repeal the acts of the other but a
to form a more precise judgment of the true merits of this
 question it will be well to advert to the proportion between the
 objects that will require a federal provision in respect to revenue
 suffice in time of peace but would it be wise or would it not
 rather be the extreme of folly to stop at this point and to leave
 the government intrusted with the care of the national defense in a
 in politics of tying up the hands of government from offensive war
 founded upon reasons of state yet certainly we ought not to disable
 it from guarding the community against the ambition or enmity of
 beneficent sentiments of peace and that to model our political
 systems upon speculations of lasting tranquillity is to calculate
 on the weaker springs of the human character
 the maintenance of fleets and armies if on the one hand it
 should be observed that the expenses incurred in the prosecution of
 the ambitious enterprises and vainglorious pursuits of a monarchy
 discharged the only call for revenue of any consequence which the
 state governments will continue to experience will be for the mere
 support of their respective civil list to which if we add all
 the principle of a repartition of the objects of revenue between
 the union and its members in proportion to their comparative
 necessities what particular fund could have been selected for the
 which has been elsewhere laid down that a concurrent jurisdiction
 in the article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an
 entire subordination in respect to this branch of power of state
 indefinite power of taxation in the union i shall make one general
 remark which is that if the jurisdiction of the national
 government in the article of revenue should be restricted to
 the manufacturing classes to whom they give a premature monopoly of
 the markets they sometimes force industry out of its more natural
 channels into others in which it flows with less advantage and in
 equitable that those duties should form the only national fund
 when they are paid by the merchant they operate as an additional
 tax upon the importing state whose citizens pay their proportion of
 would of course suffer in a double light from restraining the
 jurisdiction of the union to commercial imposts
so far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the
one which if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition
 seems most to be relied on is that the house of representatives is
 not sufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different
 take place in practice mechanics and manufacturers will always be
 inclined with few exceptions to give their votes to merchants in
 preference to persons of their own professions or trades those
 merchants as the natural representatives of all these classes of the
 community
with regard to the learned professions little need be observed
 less the case in the senate which consists of a smaller number
 than in the assembly which is composed of a greater number where
 the qualifications of the electors are the same whether they have
 encumber it will not the merchant understand and be disposed to
 cultivate as far as may be proper the interests of the mechanic
 and manufacturing arts to which his commerce is so nearly allied
 posterity by the laws to which he gives his assent are the true
 and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the
 representative and the constituent
federalist no 
the same subject continued
concerning the general power of taxation
 they particularly belong but from the society in general the door
 ought to be equally open to all and i trust for the credit of
 human nature that we shall see examples of such vigorous plants
there is another objection of a somewhat more precise nature
 that claims our attention it has been asserted that a power of
 internal taxation in the national legislature could never be
 wealth property and industry
nations in general even under governments of the more popular
 kind usually commit the administration of their finances to single
 itself or can easily be procured from any wellinformed man
 especially of the mercantile class the circumstances that may
 distinguish its situation in one state from its situation in another
 persons or to prescribe the manner of their election or appointment
 to fix their numbers and qualifications and to draw the general
 outlines of their powers and duties and what is there in all this
 mentioned there is a provision that all duties imposts and
 excises shall be uniform throughout the united states
it has been very properly observed by different speakers and
 repugnancy of authority the laws cannot therefore in a legal
 sense interfere with each other and it is far from impossible to
 avoid an interference even in the policy of their different systems
 imposing the tax is exclusively vested in the union which applies
 to the duties on imports the other where the object has not
 fallen under any state regulation or provision which may be
 government instead of making federal influence flow in an opposite
 and adverse current but all suppositions of this kind are
 invidious and ought to be banished from the consideration of the
 tributary to the public treasury in order to diminish the necessity
 of those impositions which might create dissatisfaction in the
 poorer and most numerous classes of the society happy it is when
 government there are certain emergencies of nations in which
 expedients that in the ordinary state of things ought to be
 forborne become essential to the public weal and the government
 thought worthy of the hostilities of the opponents of the
 constitution or of too manifest propriety to admit of controversy
 the mass of judiciary power however might have claimed an
 fully the merits of this constitution and the expediency of
 adopting it our plan cannot be complete without taking a more
 critical and thorough survey of the work of the convention without
 own publications that they have scanned the proposed constitution
 not only with a predisposition to censure but with a
 predetermination to condemn as the language held by others betrays
 to a just estimate of the means of promoting it
persons of this character will proceed to an examination of the
 plan submitted by the convention not only without a disposition to
 no other light than that of beacons which give warning of the
 course to be shunned without pointing out that which ought to be
 pursued the most that the convention could do in such a situation
 are among the chief blessings of civil society an irregular and
 mutable legislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious
 to the people and it may be pronounced with assurance that the
 single hand
how far the convention may have succeeded in this part of their
 work will better appear on a more accurate view of it from the
 succeeded in tracing with certainty the line which separates the
 district of vegetable life from the neighboring region of
 unorganized matter or which marks the ermination of the former and
 of the most enlightened legislatures and jurists has been equally
 unsuccessful in delineating the several objects and limits of
 different codes of laws and different tribunals of justice the
 formed but that they should be expressed by words distinctly and
 exclusively appropriate to them but no language is so copious as
 to supply words and phrases for every complex idea or so correct as
 interfering pretensions of the larger and smaller states we cannot
 err in supposing that the former would contend for a participation
 in the government fully proportioned to their superior wealth and
 every state may be divided into different districts and its
 citizens into different classes which give birth to contending
 interests and local jealousies so the different parts of the united
 which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in
 the critical stages of the revolution
we had occasion in a former paper to take notice of the
 proceedings the second conclusion is that all the deputations
 composing the convention were satisfactorily accommodated by the
 final act or were induced to accede to it by a deep conviction of
 lycurgus was the lawgiver of sparta the foundation of the
 original government of rome was laid by romulus and the work
 completed by two of his elective successors numa and tullius
 advocates for a regular reform could prevail they all turned their
 eyes towards the single efforts of that celebrated patriot and sage
 instead of seeking to bring about a revolution by the intervention
 have indulged a more temporizing policy confessed that he had not
 given to his countrymen the government best suited to their
 happiness but most tolerable to their prejudices and lycurgus
 and amendments suggested by the several states when these articles
 were submitted for their ratification not one is found which
 alludes to the great and radical error which on actual trial has
 danger after coolly revolving his situation and the characters of
 different physicians selects and calls in such of them as he judges
 most capable of administering relief and best entitled to his
such a patient and in such a situation is america at this moment
 she has been sensible of her malady she has obtained a regular
 and unanimous advice from men of her own deliberate choice and she
 places of election an objector in a large state exclaims loudly
 against the unreasonable equality of representation in the senate
 an objector in a small state is equally loud against the dangerous
 and firm against its opposite propensities with another class of
 adversaries to the constitution the language is that the
 legislative executive and judiciary departments are intermixed in
 power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department we
 concur fully reply others in the objection to this part of the
 plan but we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the
 a second convention with full powers and for the express purpose
 of revising and remoulding the work of the first were the
 experiment to be seriously made though it required some effort to
 and commodious building because the latter had not a porch to it
 or because some of the rooms might be a little larger or smaller or
 the ceilings a little higher or lower than his fancy would have
 against the new constitution that it empowers the senate with the
 concurrence of the executive to make treaties which are to be the
 laws of the land the existing congress without any such control
 apprehended from a defective construction of the supreme government
 of the union it is now no longer a point of speculation and hope
 that the western territory is a mine of vast wealth to the united
 authority yet no blame has been whispered no alarm has been
 sounded a great and independent fund of revenue is passing into
 the hands of a single body of men who can raise troops to an

federalist no 
the conformity of the plan to republican principles
 recurring to principles but in the application of the term by
 political writers to the constitution of different states no
 satisfactory one would ever be found holland in which no particle

 from the great body of the society not from an inconsiderable
 proportion or a favored class of it otherwise a handful of
 constitutions again as well as according to the most respectable
 and received opinions on the subject the members of the judiciary
 department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good
 that of the senates of new york and virginia the president is to
 continue in office for the period of four years as in new york and
 delaware the chief magistrate is elected for three years and in
 federal form which regards the union as a confederacy of sovereign
 states instead of which they have framed a national government
 which regards the union as a consolidation of the states and it
 the people of america given by deputies elected for the special
 purpose but on the other that this assent and ratification is to
 be given by the people not as individuals composing one entire
 majority in each state must bind the minority and the will of the
 majority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual
 votes or by considering the will of the majority of the states as
 in their political characters the votes allotted to them are in a
 compound ratio which considers them partly as distinct and coequal
 societies partly as unequal members of the same society the
 the national countenance of the government on this side seems to be
 disfigured by a few federal features but this blemish is perhaps
 unavoidable in any plan and the operation of the government on the
 own sphere in this relation then the proposed government cannot
 be deemed a national one since its jurisdiction extends to certain
 enumerated objects only and leaves to the several states a
 that of a majority of every national society to alter or abolish
 its established government were it wholly federal on the other
 hand the concurrence of each state in the union would be essential

the powers of the convention to form a mixed government examined
and sustained
agreed to by them and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of
every state will effectually provide for the same the
recommendatory act of congress is in the words
the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government
and the preservation of the union from these two acts it
appears st that the object of the convention was to establish
and be made to conspire to some common end the other is that
where the several parts cannot be made to coincide the less
important should give way to the more important part the means
reform of the government was to be introduced as the means or
whether the establishment of a government adequate to the
national happiness was the end at which these articles

have touched the substance of the confederation the states
would never have appointed a convention with so much solemnity
government act immediately on individuals in cases of capture
of piracy of the post office of coins weights and measures
of trade with the indians of claims under grants of land by
with the plan of congress as to recognize the principle of the
innovation do these principles in fine require that the
powers of the general government should be limited and that
of remark that this objection though the most plausible has
been the least urged in the publications which have swarmed
against the convention the forbearance can only have proceeded
now to recollect that the powers were merely advisory and
recommendatory that they were so meant by the states and so
understood by the convention and that the latter have
minds and bosoms of every external and internal foe to the
liberty and prosperity of the united states they had seen in the
origin and progress of the experiment the alacrity with which
move in concert towards their object and it is therefore
essential that such changes be instituted by some informal and
unauthorized propositions made by some patriotic and respectable
degree of power vested in them and still more their
recommendation of any measure whatever not warranted by their
commission would not less excite animadversion than a
utterly unknown to their constitutions for congress who
recommended the appointment of this body equally unknown to the
confederation and for the state of new york in particular
finally if they had violated both their powers and their
obligations in proposing a constitution this ought nevertheless
to be embraced if it be calculated to accomplish the views and
states is the aggregate power of the general government greater
than ought to have been vested in it this is the first
question it cannot have escaped those who have attended with
therefore that in all cases where power is to be conferred the
point first to be decided is whether such a power be necessary
to the public good as the next will be in case of an
it must be effectually confided to the federal councils is the
power of declaring war necessary no man will answer this
question in the negative it would be superfluous therefore to
preparations and establishments of every hostile nation the
means of security can only be regulated by the means and the
danger of attack they will in fact be ever determined by these
proved the final victim to her military triumphs and that the
liberties of europe as far as they ever existed have with few
exceptions been the price of her military establishments a

her neighbors the rulers of great britain have never been able
by real or artificial dangers to cheat the public into an
intrigue among her rival nations inflame their mutual
animosities and render them the instruments of foreign ambition
jealousy and revenge in america the miseries springing from her

continuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of
the legislature whereas the american constitution has lengthened

power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term
without desiring or without daring to extend the term beyond a

establishments in each as will render them as burdensome to the
properties and ominous to the liberties of the people as any

conflagration by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden
invaders these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed
exposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the phantom
of a general government which now exists and if their single
resources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against
variations both in the extent and the kind of imports and that
these variations do not correspond with the progress of
population which must be the general measure of the public
necessary for the common defense or general welfare no stronger
proof could be given of the distress under which these writers
labor for objections than their stooping to such a
whatsoever for what purpose could the enumeration of particular
powers be inserted if these and all others were meant to be
included in the preceding general power nothing is more natural
of these articles by the rules which would justify the
construction put on the new constitution and they vest in the
existing congress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever
punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and
offenses against the law of nations to regulate foreign
commerce including a power to prohibit after the year  the
latitude of construction will the term comprehend consuls yet it
has been found expedient and has been the practice of congress
to employ the inferior grades of public ministers and to send

legislative adoption the meaning of the term as defined in the

period it will receive a considerable discouragement from the

structure and organization of the government i shall confine
myself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended
the improper contributions levied on them by the latter were
these at liberty to regulate the trade between state and state
it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the
reciprocal trade of confederated states has been illustrated by
other examples as well as our own in switzerland where the
union is so very slight each canton is obliged to allow to

and contention in the federal councils and how the trade with
indians though not members of a state yet residing within its
coin is submitted of course to that authority which is to secure

transferred from the articles of confederation and is founded on
citizens of such state are entitled in every other state to

greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own
laws of several states certain descriptions of aliens who had
rendered themselves obnoxious were laid under interdicts
inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the
judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved and the
effect they shall have in other states is an evident and
valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in
the fourth class comprises the following miscellaneous powers
a power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by
securing for a limited time to authors and inventors the
government carries its own evidence with it it is a power
exercised by every legislature of the union i might say of the
world by virtue of its general supremacy without it not only
parties to the cession as they will have had their voice in the
election of the government which is to exercise authority over
them as a municipal legislature for local purposes derived from
of the united states ought to be enabled to punish it but as
newfangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines
by which violent factions the natural offspring of free
this omission and the assumption of power into which congress
have been led by it with great propriety therefore has the new
system supplied the defect the general precaution that no new
each of them against invasion and on application of the
legislature or of the executive when the legislature cannot be
convened against domestic violence in a confederacy founded
disproportionate force as well as the monarchical form of the
new confederate had its share of influence on the events it may
possibly be asked what need there could be of such a
and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter the only
restriction imposed on them is that they shall not exchange
republican for antirepublican constitutions a restriction
force to subvert a government and consequently that the
federal interposition can never be required but when it would be
improper but theoretic reasoning in this as in most other
necessarily on the same side in republican governments may not
the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary
resources of military talents and experience or of secret
doubtful on which side justice lies what better umpires could
be desired by two violent factions flying to arms and tearing a
state to pieces than the representatives of confederate states
engagements entered into before the adoption of this
constitution as being no less valid against the united states
under this constitution than under the confederation this
to dangers that are not altogether imaginary and that no real
danger can exist that the government would dare with or even
without this constitutional declaration before it to remit the
considerations which produced the privilege defended by it 
the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be
sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the
all political institutions aim and to which all such
institutions must be sacrificed perhaps also an answer may be
found without searching beyond the principles of the compact
they may be confronted the time has been when it was incumbent
on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits the
scene is now changed and with it the part which the same motives
to the people of the state of new york
a fifth class of provisions in favor of the federal authority
consists of the following restrictions on the authority of the
the right of coining money which is here taken from the states
was left in their hands by the confederation as a concurrent
right with that of congress under an exception in favor of the
character of republican government constitutes an enormous debt
against the states chargeable with this unadvised measure which
must long remain unsatisfied or rather an accumulation of guilt
from the states on the same principle with that of issuing a
paper currency bills of attainder expostfacto laws and laws
impairing the obligation of contracts are contrary to the first
first link of a long chain of repetitions every subsequent
interference being naturally produced by the effects of the
preceding they very rightly infer therefore that some thorough
of trade to the federal councils it is needless therefore to
remark further on this head than that the manner in which the
restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to
improper but have they considered whether a better form could
have been substituted there are four other possible methods
which the constitution might have taken on this subject they
the doctrine of construction or implication as the powers
delegated under the new system are more extensive the government
which is to administer it would find itself still more distressed
authority if to avoid this consequence they had attempted a
partial enumeration of the exceptions and described the residue
by the general terms not necessary or proper it must have
into question the essential powers of the union if it be asked
what is to be the consequence in case the congress shall
misconstrue this part of the constitution and exercise powers
people interested in watching the conduct of the former
violations of the state constitutions are more likely to remain
unnoticed and unredressed  this constitution and the laws
the states do not even expressly and fully recognize the existing
powers of the confederacy an express saving of the supremacy of
the former would in such states have brought into question
unnecessary that a like oath should be imposed on the officers of
the united states in favor of the state constitutions several
reasons might be assigned for the distinction i content myself
for accomplishing the necessary objects of the union the
question therefore whether this amount of power shall be
granted or not resolves itself into another question whether or
particular states but if the union as has been shown be
essential to the security of the people of america against
foreign danger if it be essential to their security against
people is the same doctrine to be revived in the new in another
shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed
to the views of political institutions of a different form it is
the preponderancy of the last than of the first scale we have
seen in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies
the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the
more worthy of our attention as the external causes by which the
component parts were pressed together were much more numerous and
powerful than in our case and consequently less powerful
of each other the state governments may be regarded as
constituent and essential parts of the federal government whilst
the latter is nowise essential to the operation or organization
employed under the constitution of the united states will be much
smaller than the number employed under the particular states
there will consequently be less of personal influence on the side
theirs also and as those of the former will be principally on
the seacoast and not very numerous whilst those of the latter
will be spread over the face of the country and will be very
allotted there would not be less than thirty or forty or even
more officers of different descriptions and many of them
persons of character and weight whose influence would lie on the
the governments of the particular states if the new constitution
be examined with accuracy and candor it will be found that the
change which it proposes consists much less in the addition of
persons our past experience is very far from countenancing an
opinion that the state governments would have lost their
constitutional powers and have gradually undergone an entire
constituted with different powers and designed for different
purposes the adversaries of the constitution seem to have lost
sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on this
these all the more domestic and personal interests of the people
will be regulated and provided for with the affairs of these
the people will be more familiarly and minutely conversant and
enlargements of its powers and importance was the side usually
taken by the men who wished to build their political consequence
on the prepossessions of their fellowcitizens if therefore
governments than of the federal government so far as the
disposition of each towards the other may be influenced by these
causes the state governments must clearly have the advantage
reason that the members of the state legislatures will be
unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects
the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach
policy than the existing government may have pursued much less
that its views will be as confined as those of the state
legislatures but only that it will partake sufficiently of the
on the other hand should an unwarrantable measure of the federal
government be unpopular in particular states which would seldom
fail to be the case or even a warrantable measure be so which
by the dread of a foreign yoke and unless the projected
innovations should be voluntarily renounced the same appeal to
a trial of force would be made in the one case as was made in the
time elect an uninterupted succession of men ready to betray
both that the traitors should throughout this period
uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the

citizens with arms in their hands officered by men chosen from
among themselves fighting for their common liberties and united
who could collect the national will and direct the national
force and of officers appointed out of the militia by these
governments and attached both to them and to the militia it may
and its schemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the
state governments who will be supported by the people on
summing up the considerations stated in this and the last paper
principal objections inculcated by the more respectable
adversaries to the constitution is its supposed violation of the
political maxim that the legislative executive and judiciary
persuade myself however that it will be made apparent to every
one that the charge cannot be supported and that the maxim on
which it relies has been totally misconceived and misapplied in
that particular system that we may be sure then not to mistake
his meaning in this case let us recur to the source from which
the maxim was drawn                                             
these facts by which montesquieu was guided it may clearly be
inferred that in saying there can be no liberty where the
legislative and executive powers are united in the same person
he has the appointment of those who do administer it the judges
can exercise no executive prerogative though they are shoots
from the executive stock nor any legislative function though
with all the violence of an oppressor  some of these reasons
are more fully explained in other passages but briefly stated as
they are here they sufficiently establish the meaning which we
a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments the
president who is the head of the executive department is the
presiding member also of the senate and besides an equal vote
department in the very constitution to which it is prefixed a
partial mixture of powers has been admitted the executive
magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body and
the legislative department and what is more gives a like
control to the judiciary department and even blends the
executive and judiciary departments in the exercise of this
the legislative department predominates in conjunction with an
executive council he appoints the members of the judiciary
department and forms a court of impeachment for trial of all
officers may be removed on address of the legislature maryland
has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified terms declaring
that the legislative executive and judicial powers of
the legislative department the constitution of north carolina
which declares that the legislative executive and supreme
judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and
been kept totally separate and distinct i wish not to be
regarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the
several state governments i am fully aware that among the many
madison
to the people of the state of new york
it was shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there
practical security for each against the invasion of the others
what this security ought to be is the great problem to be
solved will it be sufficient to mark with precision the
authority they seem never to have recollected the danger from
legislative usurpations which by assembling all power in the
same hands must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by
against the enterprising ambition of this department that the
people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their
precautions the legislative department derives a superiority in
have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what i
advance on this subject were it necessary to verify this
experience by particular proofs they might be multiplied
definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation
that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands and
not by a single one one hundred and seventythree despots would
made nor if made can be effectual because in that case they
may put their proceedings into the form of acts of assembly
which will render them obligatory on the other branches they
legislature in a variety of important instances a great number
of laws had been passed violating without any apparent
necessity the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature
first a great proportion of the instances were either
immediately produced by the necessities of the war or
recommended by congress or the commanderinchief secondly in
method of guarding against the encroachments of any one
department of government by appealing to the people through a
convention
proposition is that whenever any two of the three branches of
government shall concur in opinion each by the voices of two
thirds of their whole number that a convention is necessary for
force in this reasoning and it must be allowed to prove that a
constitutional road to the decision of the people ought to be
marked out and kept open for certain great and extraordinary
governments would not possess the requisite stability if it be
true that all governments rest on opinion it is no less true
that the strength of opinion in each individual and its
forms of government and which does so much honor to the virtue
and intelligence of the people of america it must be confessed
that the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be
therefore would usually be made by the executive and judiciary
departments but whether made by one side or the other would
each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial let us view their
people they would probably be constituted themselves the judges
the same influence which had gained them an election into the
legislature would gain them a seat in the convention if this
springing out of the question itself it would be connected with
persons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the
community it would be pronounced by the very men who had been
to the people of the state of new york
it may be contended perhaps that instead of occasional appeals
to the people which are liable to the objections urged against
would be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to
which it might be urged by the force of present motives is it to
be imagined that a legislative assembly consisting of a hundred
single experiment made under circumstances somewhat peculiar be
thought to be not absolutely conclusive but as applied to the
case under consideration it involves some facts which i venture
acknowledged and lamented by themselves had this not been the
case the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally
satisfactory in all questions however unimportant in
mistake not that in one instance the contemporary legislature
denied the constructions of the council and actually prevailed
in the contest this censorial body therefore proves at the
although they might not have been personally concerned in the
administration and therefore not immediately agents in the
measures to be examined they would probably have been involved
it in a clearer light and enable us to form a more correct
judgment of the principles and structure of the government
planned by the convention in order to lay a due foundation for
qualifications being essential in the members the primary
consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which
best secures these qualifications secondly because the
government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human
nature if men were angels no government would be necessary if
angels were to govern men neither external nor internal
authority necessarily predominates the remedy for this
inconveniency is to divide the legislature into different
branches and to render them by different modes of election and
on which these observations are founded be just as i persuade
myself they are and they be applied as a criterion to the
several state constitutions and to the federal constitution it
necessarily exist in different classes of citizens if a
majority be united by a common interest the rights of the
minority will be insecure there are but two methods of
religious rights it consists in the one case in the
multiplicity of interests and in the other in the multiplicity
of sects the degree of security in both cases will depend on
violence of the stronger and as in the latter state even the
stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their
condition to submit to a government which may protect the weak
on the latter or in other words a will independent of the
society itself it is no less certain than it is important
notwithstanding the contrary opinions which have been
the definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded
as a fundamental article of republican government it was
incumbent on the convention therefore to define and establish
constitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured
to them by the federal constitution the qualifications of the
elected being less carefully and properly defined by the state
people so it is particularly essential that the branch of it
under consideration should have an immediate dependence on and
an intimate sympathy with the people frequent elections are
among political antiquaries the earliest records of subsequent
date prove that parliaments were to sit only every year not that
they were to be elected every year and even these annual
frequency of elections which has been deemed necessary in that
kingdom for binding the representatives to their constituents
does not exceed a triennial return of them and if we may argue
of their constituents so far as the disposition might exist was
extremely shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects
of their deliberation of late these shackles if i mistake not
biennial elections would have been dangerous to the public
liberties the spirit which everywhere displayed itself at the
commencement of the struggle and which vanquished the obstacles
recollecting three circumstances the first is that the federal
legislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative
authority which is vested completely in the british parliament
side and will be doubly watched on the other publius 
federalist no 
the same subject continuedthe house of representatives
magistrates might be if it were found expedient as in some
instances it actually has been daily weekly or monthly as
well as annual and if circumstances may require a deviation from
the people and unalterable by the government and a law
established by the government and alterable by the government
seems to have been little understood and less observed in any
cornerstone and has led them to seek for some security to
liberty against the danger to which it is exposed where no
constitution paramount to the government either existed or
of any other nation would be where elections were annual or
even more frequent but subject to alterations by the ordinary
power of the government the second question stated is whether
legislation than one year does to the knowledge requisite for
state legislation the very statement of the question in this
form suggests the answer that ought to be given to it in a
the different states how can the trade between the different
states be duly regulated without some knowledge of their
relative situations in these and other respects how can taxes
large and the increased intercourse among those of different
states will contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual knowledge
of their affairs as this again will contribute to a general
sometimes demand particular legislative sanction and
cooperation some portion of this knowledge may no doubt be
acquired in a mans closet but some of it also can only be
advantages the greater the proportion of new members and the
less the information of the bulk of the members the more apt will
they be to fall into the snares that may be laid for them this
elapse before an illegitimate member could be dispossessed of
his seat that the prospect of such an event would be little
check to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a seat all these
case is by no means founded on the same principle in the former
case the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of
the people with which it has a natural and universal connection
doctrine might one of our southern brethren observe that
representation relates more immediately to persons and taxation
more immediately to property and we join in the application of
federal constitution therefore decides with great propriety on
the case of our slaves when it views them in the mixed character
of persons and of property this is in fact their true
the same light when advantages were to be conferred might not
some surprise also be expressed that those who reproach the
southern states with the barbarous policy of considering as
designate the qualifications on which the right of suffrage
depend are not perhaps the same in any two states in some of
the states the difference is very material in every state a
slave as divested of two fifths of the man after all may not
another ground be taken on which this article of the
constitution will admit of a still more ready defense we have
advantages of fortune if the law allows an opulent citizen but a
single vote in the choice of his representative the respect and
consequence which he derives from his fortunate situation very
though possessing an equal vote in the public councils have an
unequal influence corresponding with the unequal importance of
these subsequent and voluntary resolutions under the proposed
and taxation will have a very salutary effect as the accuracy
of the census to be obtained by the congress will necessarily
depend in a considerable degree on the disposition if not on
rendered more worthy of attention by the weight of character and
the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed
the charges exhibited against it are first that so small a
over the difference between the smallest and largest states as
delaware whose most numerous branch consists of twentyone
representatives and massachusetts where it amounts to between
would at this time amount to between four and five hundred and
twenty or thirty years hence to a thousand on the other hand
the ratio of pennsylvania if applied to the state of delaware
recollect here the observations which were applied to the case of
biennial elections for the same reason that the limited powers
of the congress and the control of the state legislatures
in the proportion of three fifths it can scarcely be doubted
that the population of the united states will by that time if it
does not already amount to three millions at the expiration of
the principles which are incorporated with the political
character of every class of citizens i am unable to conceive that
the people of america in their present temper or under any
liberties of america cannot be unsafe in the number of hands
proposed by the federal constitution from what quarter can the
danger proceed are we afraid of foreign gold if foreign gold
the purity of our public councils in this particular ever
suffered even from the whispers of calumny is the danger
apprehended from the other branches of the federal government
to any civil offices that may be created or of which the
emoluments may be increased during the term of their election
no offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members but
another publius 
federalist no 
the same subject continuedthe total number of the house of
a variety of minute and particular objects which do not lie
within the compass of legislation is consistent with every
attribute necessary to a due performance of the legislative
found that there will be no peculiar local interests in either
which will not be within the knowledge of the representative of
the district besides this source of information the laws of the
their proceedings which would very much shorten the labors of
the general legislature and render a much smaller number of
members sufficient for it the federal councils will derive great
information so far as it may relate to local objects is
rendered necessary and difficult not by a difference of laws and
local circumstances within a single state but of those among
taken singly will be just the contrary at present some of the
states are little more than a society of husbandmen few of them
have made much progress in those branches of industry which give
large can add any thing either to the security of the people
against the government or to the knowledge of their
circumstances and interests in the legislative councils on the
certain not only that a valuable portion of freedom has been
preserved under all these circumstances but that the defects in
the british code are chargeable in a very small proportion on
the few of all the objections which have been framed against the
federal constitution this is perhaps the most extraordinary
whilst the objection itself is levelled against a pretended
class and description of citizens who are to be the electors of
the federal representatives not the rich more than the poor
not the learned more than the ignorant not the haughty heirs of
engagements in the second place they will enter into the public
service under circumstances which cannot fail to produce a
temporary affection at least to their constituents there is in
securities however would be found very insufficient without the
restraint of frequent elections hence in the fourth place the
house of representatives is so constituted as to support in the
representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of
themselves and a particular class of the society i answer the
genius of the whole system the nature of just and constitutional
profess the most flaming zeal for republican government yet
boldly impeach the fundamental principle of it who pretend to be
champions for the right and the capacity of the people to choose
federal government if this be the point on which the objection
turns it deserves to be examined is it supported by reason
this cannot be said without maintaining that five or six
wealth no person is eligible as a representative of a county
unless he possess real estate of the clear value of six hundred
pounds sterling per year nor of a city or borough unless he
congress calculating on the number of sixtyfive representatives
only it makes no difference that in these senatorial districts
and counties a number of representatives are voted for by each
of pennsylvania or the members of the assembly in the two last
states have betrayed any peculiar disposition to sacrifice the
many to the few or are in any respect less worthy of their
members will not be augmented from time to time as the progress
of population may demand it has been admitted that this
objection if well supported would have great weight the
the several states we shall find that some of them contain no
determinate regulations on this subject that others correspond
pretty much on this point with the federal constitution and that
in the house of representatives should the representatives or
people therefore of the smaller states oppose at any time a
reasonable addition of members a coalition of a very few states
supported by the more powerful states and speaking the known and
determined sense of a majority of the people will have no small
advantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of
representatives to the number of inhabitants the large states
therefore who will prevail in the house of representatives will
have nothing to do but to make reapportionments and augmentations
branches of the government this power over the purse may in
fact be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with
which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of
bill has been employed an absolute inflexibility on the side of
the latter although it could not have failed to involve every
department of the state in the general confusion has neither
more numerous an assembly may be of whatever characters
composed the greater is known to be the ascendency of passion
over reason in the next place the larger the number the
addition to their representatives the countenance of the
government may become more democratic but the soul that animates
it will be more oligarchic the machine will be enlarged but the
advantage of it to screen themselves from equitable sacrifices to
the general weal or in particular emergencies to extort
unreasonable indulgences lastly it would facilitate and foster
legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law
make or alter such regulations except as to the places of
choosing senators  this provision has not only been declaimed
future weakness and perhaps anarchy it will not be alleged
that an election law could have been framed and inserted in the
constitution which would have been always applicable to every
union entirely at their mercy they could at any moment
annihilate it by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons
to administer its affairs it is to little purpose to say that
engine for the destruction of the state governments the
violation of principle in this case would have required no
comment and to an unbiased observer it will not be less
is certainly true that the state legislatures by forbearing the
appointment of senators may destroy the national government but
it will not follow that because they have a power to do this in
greater good invites it may be easily discerned also that the
national government would run a much greater risk from a power in
the state legislatures over the elections of its house of
regard to the federal house of representatives there is intended
to be a general election of members once in two years if the
state legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of
majority of the people and the individuals who have the
greatest credit in their councils is exemplified in some of the
states at the present moment on the present question the
preservation therefore ought in no case that can be avoided to
be committed to the guardianship of any but those whose situation
will uniformly beget an immediate interest in the faithful and
 alleged that it might be employed in such a manner as to promote
 the election of some favorite class of men in exclusion of others
 by confining the places of election to particular districts and
 great mass of the people by the deliberate policy of the
 government without occasioning a popular revolution is altogether
 inconceivable and incredible
 elected immediately by the people the senate by the state
 legislatures the president by electors chosen for that purpose by
 the people there would be little probability of a common interest
 in question is placed whether in their hands or in those of the
 union
but what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in
 from the latter
the several states are in various degrees addicted to
 agriculture and commerce in most if not all of them agriculture
 situation of the country i am governed by the consideration that
 the credulous votaries of state power cannot upon their own
 principles suspect that the state legislatures would be warped
 itself could desire and thirdly that men accustomed to
 investigate the sources of public prosperity upon a large scale
 must be too well convinced of the utility of commerce to be
 right of suffrage in the choice of that body
but upon what principle is the discrimination of the places of
 election to be made in order to answer the purpose of the meditated
 other occasions are defined and fixed in the constitution and are
 unalterable by the legislature
let it however be admitted for argument sake that the
 class of men would they not be likely to prefer a conduct better
 adapted to their own immediate aggrandizement would they not
 rather boldly resolve to perpetuate themselves in office by one
the more candid opposers of the provision respecting elections
 contained in the plan of the convention when pressed in argument
 will sometimes concede the propriety of that provision with this
 alarm from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to
 elections than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to
 the national government in the same respect a review of their
 district can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote
 subdivisions of the counties of albany saratoga cambridge etc
 or in any part of the county of montgomery would take the trouble
 furnish no apology for those which are to be found in the plan
 proposed i answer that as the former have never been thought
 chargeable with inattention to the security of liberty where the
 to a preference of a particular class of electors than that a
 similar spirit should take possession of the representatives of
 thirteen states spread over a vast region and in several respects
 consequence of this diversity would be that there could never happen
 a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time if an
 improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it that
 purpose fixed in the constitution of this state no better answer
 can be given than that it was a matter which might safely be
 entrusted to legislative discretion and that if a time had been
the heads into which this member of the government may be
 considered are i the qualification of senators ii the
 appointment of them by the state legislatures iii the equality of
 public confidence and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of
 them which might create a channel for foreign influence on the
 national councils
 in the common councils it does not appear to be without some reason
 that in a compound republic partaking both of the national and
 federal character the government ought to be founded on a mixture
 of sovereignty remaining in the individual states and an instrument
 for preserving that residuary sovereignty so far the equality
 ought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small
 be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in
 contemplation
iv the number of senators and the duration of their
 superfluous to enlarge on it i will barely remark that as the
 improbability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the
 dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies it must be politic to
 the most part from pursuits of a private nature continued in
 appointment for a short time and led by no permanent motive to
 devote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws
 assert that in american governments too little attention has been
 paid to the last the federal constitution avoids this error and
 what merits particular notice it provides for the last in a mode
 plans or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all
 is marked at once by all prudent people as a speedy victim to his
 own unsteadiness and folly his more friendly neighbors may pity
 their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be
 read or so incoherent that they cannot be understood if they be
 repealed or revised before they are promulgated or undergo such
 will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows
 not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be
 executed what farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the
to the people of the state of new york
a fifth desideratum illustrating the utility of a senate is
 the want of a due sense of national character without a select and
 would probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind
yet however requisite a sense of national character may be it
 is evident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous
 paradoxical it must nevertheless be acknowledged when explained
 to be as undeniable as it is important
responsibility in order to be reasonable must be limited to
 events resulting from the mixed transactions of several years it
 is sufficiently difficult to preserve a personal responsibility in
 the members of a numerous body for such acts of the body as have an
 for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready
 to lament and condemn in these critical moments how salutary will
 be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of
 from some of the dangers incident to lesser republics will expose
 them to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time under the
 influence of those misrepresentations which the combined industry of
 ancient as modern and which render extreme circumspection
 necessary in reasoning from the one case to the other but after
 allowing due weight to this consideration it may still be
 neither to deny its existence nor to undervalue its importance i
 feel the less restraint therefore in observing that the position
 concerning the ignorance of the ancient governments on the subject
 appointment appears to have been elective by the suffrages of the
 people similar instances might be traced in most if not all the
 popular governments of antiquity
 in favor of the united states but to insure to this advantage its
 full effect we must be careful not to separate it from the other
 advantage of an extensive territory for it cannot be believed
 corrupt the state legislatures must then corrupt the house of
 representatives and must finally corrupt the people at large it
 is evident that the senate must be first corrupted before it can
 within the term of its appointment and at the same time is not
 under the control of any such rotation as is provided for the
 federal senate there are some other lesser distinctions which
 elected for seven years and in very great proportion by a very
 small proportion of the people here unquestionably ought to be
 seen in full display the aristocratic usurpations and tyranny which
 government which has the people on its side to these examples
 might be added that of carthage whose senate according to the
 testimony of polybius instead of drawing all power into its vortex

 if the observation be well founded that wise kings will always be

 only be approached and achieved by measures which not only talents

 be derived from talents information integrity and deliberate
 because they have given the power of making laws to the legislature

 one indeed if it should forget that the good of the whole can only
 be promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members

 talents and integrity we have reason to be persuaded that the
 therefore conclude this head with a view of the judicial character
 of the senate
a wellconstituted court for the trial of impeachments is an
 difficulty of placing it rightly in a government resting entirely
 on the basis of periodical elections will as readily be perceived
 when it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it
 branch of that body to a share of the inquiry the model from which
 the idea of this institution has been borrowed pointed out that
 course to the convention in great britain it is the province of
 possess the degree of credit and authority which might on certain
 occasions be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a
 decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by
 conclusion that the supreme court would have been an improper
 substitute for the senate as a court of impeachments there
 remains a further consideration which will not a little strengthen
 double security intended them by a double trial the loss of life
 and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence which in
 its terms imported nothing more than dismission from a present and
 substantially avoided this was perhaps the prudent mean i
 forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamor against the
 judiciary which so considerable an augmentation of its authority

 compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying
 them the second will be espoused with caution by those who will

 scene of anarchy and the world a desert where is the standard of
 perfection to be found who will undertake to unite the discordant
 which may still exist in regard to this matter
the first of these objections is that the provision in question
 confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body in
 persons both accusers and judges and guards against the danger of
 persecution from the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of
 those branches as the concurrence of two thirds of the senate will

 aristocratic the senate it is observed is to have concurrent
 authority with the executive in the formation of treaties and in the
 appointing to offices will i trust be placed in a light not less
 satisfactory in the disquisitions under the same head and i

 the sole right of instituting impeachments is not this a complete
 counterbalance to that of determining them the same house will be
 those who appoint them with equal plausibility might it be alleged
 in this case that the favoritism of the latter would always be an
 asylum for the misbehavior of the former but that practice in
 the advice and consent of the senate to appoint there will of
 course be no exertion of choice on the part of the senate they
 may defeat one choice of the executive and oblige him to make
 treaty what prospect it is asked would there be of their being
 made to suffer the punishment they would deserve when they were
 themselves to decide upon the accusation brought against them for
 instruments of foreign corruption but they could not with more or
 with equal propriety have contemplated the impeachment and
 punishment of two thirds of the senate consenting to an improper

 in dignity and splendor to those of a king of great britain he has
 been shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the
 imperial purple flowing in his train he has been seated on a

 candid and tolerant they must force the sentiments which favor an
 indulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to
 or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of

the second clause of the second section of the second article
 appointments of senators whose appointments are otherwise provided
 for in the constitution and who are established by the
 constitution and will not require a future establishment by law
 secondly if this clause is to be considered as supplementary
 to the one which precedes the vacancies of which it speaks must be
 construed to relate to the officers described in the preceding
 suggestion under examination has been founded the vacancies to
 which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in
 whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the
 by hypocrisy
i have taken the pains to select this instance of
 misrepresentation and to place it in a clear and strong light as
the mode of appointment of the chief magistrate of the united
 states is almost the only part of the system of any consequence
 which has escaped without severe censure or which has received the
 will be most likely to possess the information and discernment
 requisite to such complicated investigations
it was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity
 one querter but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain
 an improper ascendant in our councils how could they better
 gratify this than by raising a creature of their own to the chief
 number of men requires time as well as means nor would it be
 found easy suddenly to embark them dispersed as they would be over
 thirteen states in any combinations founded upon motives which
 be the president but as a majority of the votes might not always
 happen to centre in one man and as it might be unsafe to permit
 less than a majority to be conclusive it is provided that in such
 ill administration though we cannot acquiesce in the political
 heresy of the poet who says  for forms of government let fools
 contest that which is best  administered is best
 vote the other consideration is that as the vicepresident may
 occasionally become a substitute for the president in the supreme
 executive magistracy all the reasons which recommend the mode of
 executive as they are marked out in the plan of the convention
 this will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the
 representations which have been made in regard to it
 influence throughout the united states we must conclude that a
 duration of four years for the chief magistrate of the union is a
 degree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office than a
 negative upon the acts of the two houses of parliament the disuse
 of that power for a considerable time past does not affect the
 reality of its existence and is to be ascribed wholly to the
 united states except in cases of impeachment to recommend to the
 consideration of congress such measures as he shall judge necessary
 and expedient to convene on extraordinary occasions both houses
 nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military
 and naval forces as first general and admiral of the confederacy
 while that of the british king extends to the declaring of war and
 prerogative of pardoning if a governor of new york therefore
 should be at the head of any such conspiracy until the design had
 been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices
 fourthly the president can only adjourn the national legislature
 in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment
 the british monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the parliament
 sanction the parliament it is true is sometimes seen employing
 itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the
 stipulations in a new treaty and this may have possibly given
 and other public ministers this though it has been a rich theme
 of declamation is more a matter of dignity than of authority it
 is a circumstance which will be without consequence in the
 of appointment is with us lodged in a council composed of the
 governor and four members of the senate chosen by the assembly
 the governor claims and has frequently exercised the right of
hence it appears that except as to the concurrent authority of
 the president in the article of treaties it would be difficult to
 determine whether that magistrate would in the aggregate possess
 would have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices
 the other is the sole author of all appointments the one can
 confer no privileges whatever the other can make denizens of
 truth is on the contrary that his prerogative in this respect is
 immenmorial and was only disputed contrary to all reason and

 that resolution is a law and resistance to it punishable but no
 favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of
 whole system of administration if no such cabal should exist the
 mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to
 tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of
 number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of
 agency though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been
 mismanagement yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose

 their part have charged it upon his nomination while the people
 remain altogether at a loss to determine by whose influence their

 nation for the advice they give without this there would be no
 responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea

 be admitted to be applicable to the case i should contend that the
 advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous

 than if it be lodged in the hands of one man who from the very
 circumstance of his being alone will be more narrowly watched and
 expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal
 utility i will only add that prior to the appearance of the
 constitution i rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the
 vigorous executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican
 government the enlightened wellwishers to this species of
 government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of
 on this head a feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the
 government a feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad
 execution and a government ill executed whatever it may be in
 energy as the most necessary qualification of the former and have
 regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand while
 they have with equal propriety considered the latter as best

 the votaries of an executive council are the most numerous they
 are both liable if not to equal to similar objections and may in

 personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their
 order in addition to this motive of union after the arms of the
 apt to spring whenever these happen they lessen the
 respectability weaken the authority and distract the plans and
 operation of those whom they divide if they should unfortunately
 and to the obstinacy of individuals who have credit enough to make
 their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind perhaps
 the question now before the public may in its consequences afford
 to which they relate from the first step to the final conclusion of
 it they constantly counteract those qualities in the executive
 which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition vigor
 plan is that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility 
responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment the
 first is the more important of the two especially in an elective
 resolution on the point these and similar pretexts are
 constantly at hand whether true or false and who is there that
 will either take the trouble or incur the odium of a strict
it is evident from these considerations that the plurality of
 the executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest
 securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated
 conduct in the exercise of his office and may observe or disregard
 the counsel given to him at his sole discretion
but in a republic where every magistrate ought to be personally
 pronounces to be deep solid and ingenious that the
 executive power is more easily confined when it is one that
 it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy
 in their usurpation than any one of them would have been no person
 would think of proposing an executive much more numerous than that

 principle of human nature that a man will be interested in whatever
 he possesses in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the
 tenure by which he holds it will be less attached to what he holds
there are some who would be inclined to regard the servile
 pliancy of the executive to a prevailing current either in the
 community or in the legislature as its best recommendation but
 when occasions present themselves in which the interests of the
 people are at variance with their inclinations it is the duty of
 the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those
 of the other to what purpose separate the executive or the
 judiciary from the legislative if both the executive and the
 judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of
 difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the
 balance of the constitution
it may perhaps be asked how the shortness of the duration in
 purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the
 magistrate
it cannot be affirmed that a duration of four years or any
 title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his
 fellowcitizens as on the one hand a duration of four years will

 promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations and these
 causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous
 mutability in the administration of the government
one ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the
 inducements to good behavior there are few men who would not feel
 much less zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious
another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to
 sordid views to peculation and in some instances to usurpation

 at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever and
 reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from
 the unwelcome reverse such a man in such a situation would be
 moment it is acquired its possessor shall be compelled to abandon
 the station in which it was acquired and to which it is adapted
 this nevertheless is the precise import of all those regulations
 the already settled train of the administration
a fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be that it would
 operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the
 independence in the magistrate d greater security to the people
 unless the exclusion be perpetual there will be no pretense to
 infer the first advantage but even in that case may he have no
 upon themselves a provision which was calculated to debar them of
 the right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite
 there may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the
 executive authority is an adequate provision for its support it
 is evident that without proper attention to this article the
 separation of the executive from the legislative department would be
 compensation which shall neither be increased nor diminished during
 the period for which he shall have been elected and he shall not
 receive within that period any other emolument from the united
the first thing that offers itself to our observation is the
 qualified negative of the president upon the acts or resolutions of
 the two houses of the legislature or in other words his power of
 in the same hands if even no propensity had ever discovered itself
 in the legislative body to invade the rights of the executive the
 rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves
 supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the executive but upon
 the supposition that the legislature will not be infallible that
 the love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to
 purpose as well as to the other but this objection will have
 little weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of
 that inconstancy and mutability in the laws which form the greatest
 resources of that influence to strangle a measure disagreeable to
 him in its progress to the throne to avoid being reduced to the
 dilemma of permitting it to take effect or of risking the
 it will not follow that because it might be rarely exercised it
 would never be exercised in the case for which it is chiefly
 designed that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights
 executive the qualified negative already described this is a power
 which would be much more readily exercised than the other a man
 who might be afraid to defeat a law by his single veto might not
 taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority a power of
 this nature in the executive will often have a silent and
 unperceived though forcible operation when men engaged in
 their revisionary capacities the other is that by being often
 associated with the executive they might be induced to embark too
 far in the political views of that magistrate and thus a dangerous
 states the propriety of this provision is so evident in itself
 and it is at the same time so consonant to the precedents of the
 state constitutions in general that little need be said to explain
 fettered or embarrassed the criminal code of every country
 partakes so much of necessary severity that without an easy access
 to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt justice would wear a
 the crime of treason this it has been urged ought to have
 depended upon the assent of one or both of the branches of the
 legislative body i shall not deny that there are strong reasons to
 condemned person availing itself of the goodnature and weakness of
 others might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an
 example was necessary on the other hand when the sedition had
 beforehand to take any step which might hold out the prospect of
 impunity a proceeding of this kind out of the usual course would
 be likely to be construed into an argument of timidity or of
 number of persons by whom a treaty may be made of those who
 espouse this objection a part are of opinion that the house of
 representatives ought to have been associated in the business while
 its operation it will be found to partake more of the legislative
 than of the executive character though it does not seem strictly to
 fall within the definition of either of them the essence of the
 participation of the whole or a portion of the legislative body in
 the office of making them
however proper or safe it may be in governments where the
 human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit
 interests of so delicate and momentous a kind as those which
 concern its intercourse with the rest of the world to the sole
 that his participation would materially add to the safety of the
 society it must indeed be clear to a demonstration that the joint
 possession of the power in question by the president and senate
 complication of the business by introducing a necessity of the
 concurrence of so many different bodies would of itself afford a
 solid objection the greater frequency of the calls upon the house
 of members had been required it would in many cases from the
 nonattendance of a part amount in practice to a necessity of
 unanimity and the history of every political establishment in

 all the powers of the union rarely consist of a greater number of
 persons than would compose the intended senate if we add to this

 entitled to particular commendation it is not easy to conceive a

 presume agree to the position that there would always be great
 agitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations whether
 they relate to ourselves or to others who are to be the objects of
 our choice or preference hence in every exercise of the power of
 provision made in this respect by the convention they contend
 that the president ought solely to have been authorized to make the
 appointments under the federal government but it is easy to show
 of the candidate will be too often out of sight in the first the
 qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party
 will be more considered than those which fit the person for the

 were to make the final appointment there can in this view be no
 difference between nominating and appointing the same motives
 refused where there were not special and strong reasons for the
 refusal
to what purpose then require the cooperation of the senate i
 operate as a barrier to the one and to the other he would be both
 ashamed and afraid to bring forward for the most distinguished or
 lucrative stations candidates who had no other merit than that of

 publicspirited men who have an influential weight in the councils

 agreeable to him by the apprehension that a discountenance of the
 senate might frustrate the attempt and bring some degree of

 senate would influence the executive as i have had occasion to
 remark in several other instances the indistinctness of the
 that magistrate the right of nomination would produce all the good
 of that of appointment and would in a great measure avoid its evils
 upon a comparison of the plan for the appointment of the
 five persons of whom the governor is always one this small body
 shut up in a private apartment impenetrable to the public eye
 proceed to the execution of the trust committed to them it is
 important part of the administration to prefer to offices men who
 are best qualified for them or whether he prostitutes that
 advantage to the advancement of persons whose chief merit is their
 mutable administration in their full extent such a council would
 also be more liable to executive influence than the senate because
 they would be fewer in number and would act less immediately under
 persons all the advantages of the stability both of the executive
 and of the senate would be defeated by this union and infinite
 delays and embarrassments would be occasioned the example of most
 has a concurrent power with the executive in the article of
 treaties it might often be necessary to call it together with a
 view to this object when it would be unnecessary and improper to
 favor of the public security in the only instances in which the
 abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared the
 chief magistrate of the united states would by that plan be

 which they are to hold their places d the partition of the
 one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice
 of government in a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the
 despotism of the prince in a republic it is a no less excellent
 its judgments
this simple view of the matter suggests several important
 consequences it proves incontestably that the judiciary is beyond
 firmness and independence as permanency in office this quality may
 therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its
 constitution and in a great measure as the citadel of the public
 constitutions a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests
 cannot be unacceptable
there is no position which depends on clearer principles than
 order among other things to keep the latter within the limits
 assigned to their authority the interpretation of the laws is the
 proper and peculiar province of the courts a constitution is in
 uncommonly happens that there are two statutes existing at one
 time clashing in whole or in part with each other and neither of
 them containing any repealing clause or expression in such a case
 proper to be followed they teach us that the prior act of a
 superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior
 and subordinate authority and that accordingly whenever a
 which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a
 duty
this independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard
 had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body
 until the people have by some solemn and authoritative act
 annulled or changed the established form it is binding upon
 to be expected from the scruples of the courts are in a manner
 compelled by the very motives of the injustice they meditate to
 qualify their attempts this is a circumstance calculated to have
 whomsoever made would in some way or other be fatal to their
 necessary independence if the power of making them was committed
 either to the executive or legislature there would be danger of an
 must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent
 knowledge of them hence it is that there can be but few men in
 the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify
 their judicial offices in point of duration and that so far from
 being blamable on this account their plan would have been
 inexcusably defective if it had wanted this important feature of
 subsistence amounts to a power over his will and we can never hope
 to see realized in practice the complete separation of the judicial
 from the legislative power in any system which leaves the former
 in half a century become penurious and inadequate it was therefore
 necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary
 its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances yet
 in the early stages of the government that a stipend which would
 be very sufficient at their first appointment would become too
 small in the progress of their service
 believe no place in the catalogue of known arts an attempt to fix
 the boundary between the regions of ability and inability would
 much oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and
 dismission of men from stations in which they have served their
 country long and usefully on which they depend for subsistence and
 from which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for
 of the provisions expressly contained in the articles of union d
 to all those in which the united states are a party th to all
 those which involve the peace of the confederacy whether they
 negative on the state laws or an authority in the federal courts to
 overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the articles
 of union there is no third course that i can imagine the latter
 conduct of its members and the responsibility for an injury ought
 ever to be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it as the
 denial or perversion of justice by the sentences of courts as well
 involve national questions that it is by far most safe and most
 expedient to refer all those in which they are concerned to the
 national tribunals
 witnesses in the course of our past experience it will readily be
 conjectured that i allude to the fraudulent laws which have been
 passed in too many of the states and though the proposed
 be committed to that tribunal which having no local attachments
 will be likely to be impartial between the different states and
 their citizens and which owing its official existence to the
 citizens of the same state claims to land under grants of
 different states founded upon adverse pretensions of boundary are
 of this description the courts of neither of the granting states
 state or the citizens thereof and foreign states citizens and
 subjects this constitutes the entire mass of the judicial
 authority of the union let us now review it in detail it is
 united states there is hardly a subject of litigation between
 individuals which may not involve those ingredients of fraud
 accident trust or hardship which would render the matter an
second to treaties made or which shall be made under the
 authority of the united states and to all cases affecting

let us now return to the partition of the judiciary authority
 founded are to this effect the authority of the proposed
 supreme court of the united states which is to be a separate and
 independent body will be superior to that of the legislature the
 which gives them any greater latitude in this respect than may be
 claimed by the courts of every state i admit however that the
 constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws
 these papers that it is not violated by vesting the ultimate power
 of judging in a part of the legislative body but though this be
 not an absolute violation of that excellent rule yet it verges so
 members of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to
 those qualifications which fit men for the stations of judges and
 as on this account there will be great reason to apprehend all the
 rectify the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts in
 any other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the
 united states the theory neither of the british nor the state
 order of the political system this may be inferred with certainty
 from the general nature of the judicial power from the objects to
 which it relates from the manner in which it is exercised from its
 these and the former
the power of constituting inferior courts is evidently
 calculated to obviate the necessity of having recourse to the
 prevalency of a local spirit may be found to disqualify the local
 tribunals for the jurisdiction of national causes whilst every man
 may discover that courts constituted like those of some of the
 aid of the state judges may hold circuits for the trial of causes
 in the several parts of the respective districts justice through
 them may be administered with ease and despatch and appeals may be
 of the nation though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic
 character yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which
 they belong the same observation is in a great measure applicable
 alienation of state sovereignty were discussed in considering the
 article of taxation and need not be repeated here a recurrence to
 the principles there established will satisfy us that there is no
 would appertain to the inferior tribunals and the supreme court
 would have nothing more than an appellate jurisdiction with such
 exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make
 abstract denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to
 review the proceedings of another either as to the law or fact or
 both the mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or
 by a jury yet they unquestionably have jurisdiction of both fact
 and law and accordingly when the former is agreed in the
 pleadings they have no recourse to a jury but proceed at once to
 are tried in this mode and such an exception would preclude
 the revision of matters of fact as well where it might be proper
 as where it might be improper to avoid all inconveniencies it
 restricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for the
 cognizance of the national judicature that in the partition of
 this authority a very small portion of original jurisdiction has
 states or larger districts it is ridiculous to imagine that county
 courts were in contemplation
 this word is composed of jus and dictio juris dictio or a
 by the convention and particularly concerning the judiciary
 department the principal of these respect the situation of the
 state courts in regard to those causes which are to be submitted to
 will retain the jurisdiction they now have unless it appears to be
 taken away in one of the enumerated modes
the only thing in the proposed constitution which wears the
 applicable to those descriptions of causes of which the state courts
 have previous cognizance it is not equally evident in relation to
 cases which may grow out of and be peculiar to the constitution to
 globe those of japan not less than of new york may furnish the
 objects of legal discussion to our courts when in addition to this
 we consider the state governments and the national governments as
 the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor neither of these
 consequences ought without evident necessity to be involved the
 latter would be entirely inadmissible as it would defeat some of
 subordinate federal judicatories this is another of the questions
 which have been raised and of greater difficulty than the former
 the following considerations countenance the affirmative the plan
 and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate
 jurisdiction of the supreme court the state tribunals may then be
 left with a more entire charge of federal causes and appeals in
 constitution in regard to civil causes is represented as an
 abolition of the trial by jury and the declamations to which it has
 afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion
 say they as the constitution has established the trial by jury in
 criminal cases and is silent in respect to civil this silence is
 an implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter
 regard to criminal causes is abridged by the express injunction of
 trial by jury in all such cases but it is of course left at
 large in relation to civil causes there being a total silence on
having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the
 use made of them let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and
 true meaning this will be best done by examples the plan of the
let us suppose that by the laws of this state a married woman
 was incapable of conveying her estate and that the legislature
 considering this as an evil should enact that she might dispose of
 and it is equally true that in those controversies between
 individuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be
 interested that institution will remain precisely in the same
 they agree in nothing else concur at least in the value they set
 upon the trial by jury or if there is any difference between them
 it consists in this the former regard it as a valuable safeguard
 cases aided by the habeascorpus act seems therefore to be
 alone concerned in the question and both of these are provided
 for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention
 tax to be levied
and as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue the
 provision in favor of trial by jury in criminal cases will afford
 the power of those officers to select jurors who would serve the
 purpose of the party as well as a corrupted bench in the next
 place it may fairly be supposed that there would be less
notwithstanding therefore the doubts i have expressed as to
 the essentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty i admit
 that it is in most cases under proper regulations an excellent
 courts of common law courts of probates analogous in certain
 matters to the spiritual courts in england a court of admiralty
 and a court of chancery in the courts of common law only the
 courts of admiralty the causes depending in them are triable by
 juries in georgia there are none but commonlaw courts and an
 appeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another which
 as well in the modification as in the extent of the institution of
 trial by jury in civil cases in the several states and from this
 fact these obvious reflections flow first that no general rule
 antecedent or previous establishment to which the term heretofore
 could relate it would therefore be destitute of a precise meaning
 and inoperative from its uncertainty
 the laws of nations of this nature among others are all prize
 causes juries cannot be supposed competent to investigations that
 require a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations and
 government in the article under consideration and the danger of
 encumbering the government with any constitutional provisions the
 propriety of which is not indisputable
 require that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some
 single and obvious point while the litigations usual in chancery
 frequently comprehend a long train of minute and independent
 judiciary according to what may be conjectured to have been the
 attempt of the pennsylvania minority let us now examine how far
 the proposition of massachusetts is calculated to remedy the
 those which have been employed to characterize that species of
 causes which it is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury
 in this state the boundaries between actions at common law and
 a plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself and which it would
 require much time and reflection to mature it would be extremely
 difficult if not impossible to suggest any general regulation that
 the convention still there would have been great danger of jealousy
 and disgust in the other states at the partiality which had been
 shown to the institutions of one the enemies of the plan would
 different lights in which the subject has been placed in the course
 of these observations will go far towards removing in candid minds
 the apprehensions they may have entertained on the point they have
 be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at
 present apply and might as advantageously be abridged in others
 it is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in
 constitutional obstacles to arrest them in a favorite career the
 truth is that the general genius of a government is all that can be
 substantially relied upon for permanent effects particular
 it is true that the principles by which that relief is
 governed are now reduced to a regular system but it is not the
 less true that they are in the main applicable to special
the most considerable of the remaining objections is that the
 plan of the convention contains no bill of rights among other
 answers given to this it has been upon different occasions remarked
 removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any
 office of honor trust or profit under the united states but the
 party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to
 unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or
 on confession in open court and clause  of the same
 section the congress shall have power to declare the punishment of
 the whole nation but confinement of the person by secretly
 hurrying him to jail where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten
 is a less public a less striking and therefore a more dangerous
 declaration of rights which under our constitutions must be
 intended as limitations of the power of the government itself
it has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights
 recognition of popular rights than volumes of those aphorisms which
 make the principal figure in several of our state bills of rights
 and which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a
 instance should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not
 be restrained when no power is given by which restrictions may be
 imposed i will not contend that such a provision would confer a
 press who can give it any definition which would not leave the
 utmost latitude for evasion i hold it to be impracticable and
 from this i infer that its security whatever fine declarations may
 define certain immunities and modes of proceeding which are
 relative to personal and private concerns this we have seen has
 also been attended to in a variety of cases in the same plan
 argument if it proves any thing proves that there ought to be no
 general government whatever for the powers which it seems to be
 agreed on all hands ought to be vested in the union cannot be
 representatives in the general government and the impediments to a
 prompt communication which distance may be supposed to create will
 be overbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the state
 ready to sound the alarm when necessary and to point out the actors
 in any pernicious project the public papers will be expeditious
 messengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the
 considerable increase of expense it would be an objection that
 ought to have no weight against the plan
the great bulk of the citizens of america are with reason
whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring one
 source indicated is the multiplication of offices under the new
 government let us examine this a little
 need of any for this purpose what difference can it make in point
 of expense to pay officers of the customs appointed by the state or
 by the united states there is no good reason to suppose that
 negotiations will naturally devolve upon him according to general
 principles concerted with the senate and subject to their final
 concurrence hence it is evident that a portion of the year will
 the several states amount to two thousand and upwards which number
 has hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the
 first instance by sixtyfive persons and probably at no future

 to show that there is a power in the constitution by which
 significant to declare that government ought to be free that taxes
 ought not to be excessive etc as that the liberty of the press
 ought not to be restrained
 the real excellences of the former among the pretended defects are
 the reeligibility of the executive the want of a council the
 omission of a formal bill of rights the omission of a provision
 and favorites to become the despots of the people in the
 diminution of the opportunities to foreign intrigue which the
 dissolution of the confederacy would invite and facilitate in the
 liberties of the people which has been indiscriminately brought
 against the advocates of the plan has something in it too wanton
 and too malignant not to excite the indignation of every man who
 and understanding and to act agreeably to the genuine and sober
 dictates of his judgment this is a duty from which nothing can
 give him a dispensation t is one that he is called upon nay
 triumph to its enemies why say they should we adopt an
 imperfect thing why not amend it and make it perfect before it is
 irrevocably established this may be plausible enough but it is
 deliberations of all collective bodies must necessarily be a
 compound as well of the errors and prejudices as of the good sense
 and wisdom of the individuals of whom they are composed the
 to the constitution the moment an alteration is made in the
 present plan it becomes to the purpose of adoption a new one and
 must undergo a new decision of each state to its complete
 hence also an immense multiplication of difficulties and
 casualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act the
 degree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the
 its powers and on this account alone i think there is no weight
 in the observation just stated i also think there is little weight
 in it on another account the intrinsic difficulty of governing
 to unite two thirds or three fourths of the state legislatures in
 amendments which may affect local interests can there be any room
 to apprehend any such difficulty in a union on points which are
 their labor time must bring it to perfection and the feeling of
 inconveniences must correct the mistakes which they inevitably fall
 into in their first trials and experiments these judicious
 other states are enemies to a general national government in every
 possible shape
