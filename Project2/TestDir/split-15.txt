overview
    the swift collapse of the yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
    ethnic warfare
    of important interrepublic trade flows
    montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
    strife
    former yugoslav republics
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs
    manufactures
    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence
    the communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
    number of giant plants
    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets
    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
    economic difficulties of the republics
    situation of serbia and montenegro is the continuation in office of a
    communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
    mastery
    sanctions by the leading industrial nations
